Senior/Staff Backend Software Engineer (Rust, Remote)

Come help us build the best API testing tool, by developers, for developers.

Who are we?

ForAllSecure is a group of people united by a shared mission: making the world’s software safe & reliable. Our first step towards that goal is to democratize fuzzing.

Fuzzing is an automated testing technique with huge impact. Microsoft reports that 80%+ of their security vulnerabilities are discovered by fuzzing. But only the biggest tech companies and best vulnerability researchers have had the resources to leverage fuzzing. We are here to break down these barriers and bring fuzzing to the masses.

Continuous fuzzing will transform how we test software in our industry at large. It will be as fundamental as unit or integration testing, and we are responsible for making that positive change happen. It will empower developers to build better and safer software, faster.

What will you do?

You will join a small team passionate about API testing. We believe that there is a better way to develop and test web APIs, and that fuzzing is part of the solution. We are driven to deliver that and help out all the API developers out there.

We are looking for people with the same passion to help build this nascent product. Your day to day will likely involve, among other things:

Adding features to our CLI and web API that will unlock more value for our customers.
Working with our customers to understand how we can better provide a valuable & delightful experience.
Coming up with feature ideas, and owning them from start to finish (ideation, validation, implementation, delivery, docs, ...)
Optionally, improving our custom fuzzing engine, to improve our speed, coverage, and bugs it finds.

You don’t know fuzzing, or much about security? That’s alright! We’d love to teach you. And there’s plenty of work around the fuzzing tech (CLI/API) if that’s something you’re more comfortable.

Oh, and everything (but frontend) is written in Rust. So if you like Rust, you’ll have a blast. If you don’t know Rust but are curious about it, we’ll help you learn it as well!

Who are we looking for?

We do not care about your credentials, or whether you can implement a red-black tree in a coding interview. Instead we care about the following:

Passion. Our mission resonates with you, and you are excited to drive it forward.
Empathy. You care deeply about your co-workers and your customers. You will make technical decisions affecting our users, and we want users to always be on top of mind.
Curiosity. You love to learn. You love to get better at things, through reading books or blog posts. You consider yourself a fast learner.
Writing skills. You appreciate and are inspired by well-written documentation. You like writing your thoughts down and sharing them with others.
Coding skills. We do not require formal education, but we do expect you to be a proficient coder. Again, you don’t need to know rust, but you should want to learn it (and will need to). Ideally, you’d have dabbled with web APIs before.

More specifically, on the technical side, we are looking for:

Experience developing backend stack (API, Database, background jobs). Specific frameworks and tools are less important.
RDBMS experience (ie: PostgreSQL)
Experience operating web services in production and handling incidents.

In addition, you will likely end up using Jenkins, Docker, Terraform, Google Cloud. We don’t require experience in those, but we do expect a willingness to learn! There are also technologies that you might end up using based on interest, including fuzzing and frontend dev.

Our Team Culture

Culture is very important to our team, and therefore wanted to share with you what you can expect if you were to join us:

Small & lean team. Highly motivated & lean team. You’ll be the 3rd engineer on the product.
Remote-first. We have folks on both US coasts, and in Canada.
Speed: Eric Ries claims speed at which you iterate is key. Iteration is not only about software, but about ""validated learnings"". He advocates a scientific approach to product development, built around quick validation of hypotheses using data from customers. This involves things like Reid Hoffman’s paper testing, and continuous delivery (we ❤️ Accelerate)
Data-driven decision making: Iteration speed enables data-driven decision making. Instead of arguing about what to build, we look at the date collected from customers. Many times, the decision requires more data and the discussion shifts to how we can get it.
Empowerment: Another important aspect of our decision making is that our team is empowered to make decisions. This avoids a number of issues. First, given that we are on the ground and close to customers (see ""Empathy"" below), we have the most context on how we can provide value to them, which is how we make this product successful. Second, we avoid design-by-committee issues. Third, giving team decision-making authority allows them to remain nimble & fast, there's not a lengthy approval process for inconsequential decisions.
Focus: The result of iteration speed & data-driven decision making is focus. We might not always build stuff that customers want (mistakes happen, and that's ok - see below). But the important part is we only keep what customers want. We don't want any dead weight slowing us down.
Psychological safety: iteration speed reduces the impact of mistakes. We avoid investing too much effort without regular validation of the work. So, in our team, we embrace failure, and failure is just another ""validated learning"". This gives the team psychological safety, one of the 5 elements of high performing teams. On the technical side, continuous delivery also dampens any mistakes we make. While a mistake may find its way to production faster, it also gets fixed in production faster.
Empathy: Engineers are close to customers. We get unfiltered feedback right from customers instead of playing a game of telephone. We can ask clarification questions. We can test our hypothesis. This also gives us the context and empathy we need in order to make good decisions. The product would not be successful if we did not do that. The empathy we gain from talking directly to customers also leads us to put a huge focus on usability, simplicity and user experience.
Async communications: Another aspect of our decision making is that we embrace written communications over meetings. It enables the writer to be more deliberate with their thinking. They have the time to do research and build a coherent and backed case. It gives people a shared background to start an informed discussion. More specifically, we follow an RFD process for important technical decisions.
Work-life balance. We care to have well-balanced & diverse team members. We can’t have that if we expect folks to work crazy hours. Heads up, you will however be expected to be part of an on-call rotation.";;;

Software Engineer: Embedded Systems;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=535ad03217428130;Remote;yes;"



The rack-scale computer is loaded with essential embedded systems, responsible for the many unseen components that support the operation of a rack-scale computer.




 As a software engineer working on embedded systems software, you will:





 Work with a friendly and positive team to write the low-level code that makes Oxide computers tick.
 Write code mostly in Rust, read code primarily written in Rust and C. The vast majority of code you write will be open source (maybe all of it!), and we are not starting with existing vendor code – we’re trying to do things right.
 Write programs that interact with the physical world, from blinking lights to rack-level thermal control systems to supporting hot-swap of server components.
 Read datasheets for relevant sensors, microcontrollers, etc., and implement drivers for them in bare-metal and embedded RTOS environments.
 Drive our device security by extending the verified boot chain from first instruction to the control plane running on Oxide systems. You’ll secure the interface among lowest level components and into the control plane, build identity and access control, and work with the team to define and defend against threats.
 Code without fear, supported by continuous builds, unit testing, memory-safe code, good debugging tools, a constructive code-review process, and a supportive culture of identifying and fixing bugs.





 These responsibilities are just a starting place! We’re a small company, we don’t have rigid roles, and we have a lot to do – we can help you grow wherever your interests take you.




 You will thrive in this role if you:





 Have previously worked with Rust or another low-level systems language such as C.
 Have worked with microcontrollers, whether it’s at a job or some kind of Arduino pet-washing coffee maker.
 Believe in fully documenting your ideas.
 Enjoy reading the documentation produced by others.
 Get excited about things and dig really deep into them.
 Are very comfortable at a Unix terminal.
 Don’t mind coworkers getting really excited about decades-old computer front panels.





 If you don’t meet 100% of these qualifications you should still seriously consider applying – at least one of us was missing each of these at the outset!




 Life at Oxide




 We are very explicit about our values, and they can be seen in daily life at Oxide, for example:





 Our rigor means we enjoy and take pride in the craft of engineering.
 Our urgency means that we are not above the judicious short-cut.
 Our versatility is reflected in our greatest strength: the breadth of our team.
 Our transparency can be seen in our consensus-driven RFD process.
 Our responsibility means that we both lead and follow: we have our own domains, but we also help others on their parts.
 Our curiosity shows in our insatiable desire to learn – and our empathy in our love of teaching others.
 Our humor is a big part of our daily lives: we are inveterate wise-crackers whose video meetings spill into simultaneous text chat.





 Our values also manifest themselves in our benefits:





 Everyone makes $185,657, regardless of location.
 We offer the best health insurance we could find: medical PPO plan, dental, and vision that are 100% covered for both employees and dependents.
 We are very supportive of remote work. About half of our team is outside of the San Francisco Bay Area; our only requirement is working hours with a significant overlap with Pacific Time.
 Our families and lives outside of our jobs are very important to us; our schedules are flexible to reflect and support that.

Software Engineer: Control Plane;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=6806193cfb351b76;Remote;yes;"



The control plane is the spinal column of Oxide's software: it is responsible for managing and provisioning virtual machines, storage and networking.




 As a software engineer working on the control plane, you will:





 Collaborate with other engaged, friendly, systems-oriented engineers to understand customer use cases and implement the core of the Oxide platform.
 Operate across multiple layers of the stack to build the fault-tolerant distributed systems and databases that support virtual machines, network-based virtual storage devices, and virtual networks.
 Drive our device security by extending the verified boot chain from early boot to all the software running on Oxide systems. You’ll secure the interface to the control plane, build identity and access control, and work with the team to define and defend against threats.
 Develop tools to test and analyze complex systems, including those deployed in production at customer sites. Logging, tracing, and metrics are critical pieces of distributed systems, and you’ll get the chance to dig into them all.
 Write code mostly in Rust, read code primarily written in Rust and C. The vast majority of code you write will be open source (maybe all of it!), across many different codebases.
 Code without fear, working with the team to create and maintain continuous builds, tests, memory-safe code, debugging tools, a constructive code-review process, and a supportive culture of identifying and fixing bugs. Contribute to other, non-control plane areas of the product that interest you.





 These responsibilities are just a starting place! We’re a small company, we don’t have rigid roles, and we have a lot to do – we can help you grow wherever your interests take you.




 You will thrive in this role if you:





 Have previously worked with Rust or another low-level systems language such as C.
 Are energized by the thought of jumping between handling multi-machine fault tolerance, analyzing storage latency patterns, and bringing kernel drivers to life.
 Believe in fully documenting your ideas.
 Enjoy reading the documentation produced by others.
 Get excited about a wide range of technical topics and dig really deep into them.
 Are very comfortable at a Unix terminal.
 Don’t mind coworkers getting really excited about decades-old computer front panels.





 If you don’t meet 100% of these qualifications you should still seriously consider applying – at least one of us was missing each of these at the outset!




 Life at Oxide




 We are very explicit about our values, and they can be seen in daily life at Oxide, for example:





 Our rigor means we enjoy and take pride in the craft of engineering.
 Our urgency means that we are not above the judicious short-cut.
 Our versatility is reflected in our greatest strength: the breadth of our team.
 Our transparency can be seen in our consensus-driven RFD process.
 Our responsibility means that we both lead and follow: we have our own domains, but we also help others on their parts.
 Our curiosity shows in our insatiable desire to learn – and our empathy in our love of teaching others.
 Our humor is a big part of our daily lives: we are inveterate wise-crackers whose video meetings spill into simultaneous text chat.





 Our values also manifest themselves in our benefits:

Remote Junior iOS Engineer;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=9a30992782e357ea;Remote;yes;"REMOTE /ENGINEERING – DRIVE AXLE /ENGINEER

About us
Eleos Technologies is a growing 10-year-old company building communication software for truck drivers and field workers.
We’re helping a diverse mix of customers—from mom and pop operations to thousand-truck fleets—improve how they communicate with their employees by tackling information overload, reducing phone calls, and eliminating obsolete technologies.
Our engineering team has been 100% distributed since day one. This means we’re tooled up to handle product, architectural, technical, and ops work all from home or remote. You won’t miss out of office conversations, and you won’t have to learn to drive a telepresence robot.
We began life as a bootstrapped startup, which allowed us to focus on building products our customers love. Today, we're part of the Knight-Swift family, which has allowed us to keep our focus and the freedom to build the best products we can for the transportation industry. We offer robust healthcare (dental, medical, vision), paid time off, and a generous equipment budget.
About the role
Our app is more than the usual ""CRUD and chat"": in addition to industry-leading truck navigation and planning tools, we’ve got some advanced algorithms for identifying the best and safest vehicle route, document scanning, and more—all on the device.
Drive Axle is our consumer-facing document scanning app. We’re looking to scale up a team to invest further into this product and ship more advanced scanning capabilities, driver planning tools, and other features to make individual drivers’ lives easier.
As a member of our Drive Axle team, you’ll get to leave your mark on our app’s architecture, UI, and all the way down to the database and network guts. Since we’re a small team, you’ll have opportunities to review and work on web backend or frontend code in other languages outside the iOS ecosystem, should you wish to do so.
Thousands of people across the country rely on our app to do their jobs, and we take quality seriously. We have a unit and acceptance test suite that gives us the confidence to move fast. You’ll write tests for the code you write, and work to both share and expand your skills around automated testing. We have CI that produces builds for the whole team to try within a few minutes of a commit or pull request being opened and a similar process for cutting release-ready builds for distribution.
About you
We're looking for a junior engineer who can help maintain, evolve, and improve Drive Axle, our consumer-facing iOS app, which is the single pane through which many of our users experience our core product.
You should have experience working with UIKit or SwiftUI and the native iOS networking stack. You should also be reasonably comfortable using Xcode’s debugging tools such as breakpoints. If you don’t already happen to have experience with them, we’ll help you learn Core Data and the other system frameworks we use as you go.
We'd like someone who's both ready to teach others (you'll know things we don't!) and learn from co-workers in a fun, productive, and respectful environment.
Key skills
1+ years professional experience building or maintaining a shipping native iOS app in Objective-C and/or Swift (we've got some of each; new code is all Swift)
The ability to quickly convey ideas, opinions, and technical details in written English
Able to work 8-5 Eastern Standard Time ± 3 hours, to facilitate real time collaboration when needed
Not requirements, but things to mention if they apply to you
An app you've worked on is available in the App Store
Android app development experience
Experience writing JavaScript or Ruby
Rust, C++ or C skills
Image processing, GIS/mapping, fleet management, or computer vision experience
Technology
We take a “reasoned opinions, weakly held” approach to tools, and resist letting those tools define our identity. That said, we’ve had positive experiences with CircleCI, fastlane, Google MLKit, SQLite, and a handful of other libraries that do their jobs well.

On the backend, we've got Elixir, Erlang, and PostgreSQL running in AWS.

About Protocol LabsProtocol Labs drives breakthroughs in computing to push humanity forward. Protocol Labs is a product-development lab, but behind the protocols and tools we build, behind the research and implementations, are passionate people, teammates, and community members. Most teams in the Protocol Labs Network are fully distributed and work remotely around the world. Engineers, researchers, and operators work in the open to improve the internet — humanity's most important technology — as we explore new advances at the intersection of many exciting fields (crypto, networks, distributed systems) and cultures (startups, research, open-source, distributed work).
The IPLD team seeks driven engineers to help build out reusable libraries and algorithms for decentralized data wrangling. The position involves software development, understanding interoperability, and deep technical specification work to make sure everything we do can also be done by others in their programming languages of choice.Software Engineering at Protocol LabsSoftware engineering and distributed systems thinking lies at the center of many projects at Protocol Labs. With IPLD, IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin, and other related projects, we are laying the foundation for a more resilient, more secure, distributed version of the web. This requires rigorous engineering from protocol design through all the phases of implementation. We strike a balance between pragmatism (put it on a ship ), deeply informed protocol design, and strict application of strong engineering principles. All of this happens in an environment defined by curiosity, passion, and a love for open source.As Software Engineer in the IPLD team at Protocol Labs you will…

Join us in maintaining and growing open source projects with hundreds of downstream consumers.
Build the decentralization revolution! Work on foundational algorithms for data structures, serialization, sharding, content-addressing — all the things needed to build robust and scalable decentralized protocols.
Develop and ship algorithms for handling data at all sizes.
Focus on supporting other developers — we aim to make development in the decentralized universe easier and more high-leverage; that means lots of listening and planning.
Think deeply about how software shapes thought processes. We're not just slinging code here; we're trying to build a vision, and communicate it through code and through doing.
Write design documents to “think out loud” about features we might build. Then write specs, for the features we do build!
Implement performance critical code (stuff that goes inside other people’s hot loops), such as codecs, and other data transformation tools.
Communicate! We serve not just Protocol Labs, but aim to build and to serve a wider community of developers who have aligned goals and should benefit from using our software.
Want examples? Look at what we do by checking out the repos in github.com/ipld/ , and the ipld.io website.

You may be a fit for this role if you have...

Solid experience in one of our core languages — Golang, JavaScript (and TypeScript), or Rust.
Deep familiarity with merkle data structures. (E.g., You should consider git to be a “duh”.)
Familiarity and experience with working in the open. (We do all our work on GitHub, and open is the default here!)
Excitement to ship under Apache2+MIT dual license by default! (Okay, you don't need to be a license nerd, but if you are, we hope you find this pretty dang good.)
Mature understanding of how design choice consequences shape and continue to affect a software library in the long run — especially when it's at the bottom of a deep dependency stack, and thus changes need planning. (We live this every day.)
Strong written communication skills. We’re async by default, so writing matters. Documentation for code, design docs for proposed work, specifications for finished systems, and just plain daily communication — we do a lot of writing.
A strong priority for testing. We develop complicated stuff, and we want it to work — and we want other people to implement things in their own languages of choice, too. That means being incredibly spec-driven and constantly investing in serialized, language-agnostic test fixtures.
Remote work experience. We're a full remote company and always have been. You'll immediately have direct colleagues from all around the world. (Timezones are fun!)
At least a little sense of whimsy! We're creating new things; we do spikes all the time. Creativeness is necessary, and also sometimes the ability to let things go just as quickly as they came if they don’t work out.

Bonus points...

If you have a polyglot background, it’s a huge plus. (We spend a lot of time thinking about how various systems should be implemented in other languages, so it helps!)
If you have prior experience with performance profiling, e.g. pprof and tracking down memory allocations, it’s handy. (If not, you can gain that skill while working with us.)
If you have experience in type theory, it’s a plus. (We think regularly about how to make programming better. Type systems often don't apply in a typical way for us, because we build systems to support decentralized and data-first systems development; but the background is still often transferrable.)
If you've worked on codecs before, you’ll definitely find transferable experiences here. (It's a good practical experience to have; even when not working on codecs, having an intuition for their natural performance envelopes is dang handy.)

#LI-NS1What’s it like to work at Protocol Labs?
Protocol Labs' mission is to improve humanity’s most important technology, the Internet. We build protocols, systems, and tools to improve how it works. Today, we are focused on how we store, locate, and move information. Our projects include IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p, and more.
As a distributed team, we hire anywhere in the world, and at various levels of experience (entry, senior, staff). We look for people with unique perspectives and diverse backgrounds.

HUMAN was founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore by Tamer Hassan, Michael Tiffany, Dan Kaminsky, and Ash Kalb. Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Verification Engine, the backbone of all our products that protect enterprises from sophisticated bots. Today we verify the humanity of more than 15 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms across the internet.
   


 Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to helping protect companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by malicious bots. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive benefits and day-to-day culture in order for every human to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).
   


 The HUMAN R&D team is pivotal to our mission to protect the heart of the internet by disrupting the economics of cybercrime. They are the ones uncovering and fighting bot operations like PARETO, ICEBUCKET, 3ve, and Methbot. HUMAN supports our R&D humans by strongly valuing deep work and flexibility. Company-wide meeting-free Fridays give you uninterrupted time to work on your projects. Additionally, this team is encouraged to participate in R&D Research Friday - a designated half-day each week dedicated to trying new ideas and personal career development.

    You will look for new ways to uncover fraud and highlight patterns of abuse that only HUMAN can deliver given our history of successfully reducing sophisticated IVT across programmatic advertising.
   



What you will do:

 Implement solutions to problems in Golang, possibly in Java and other languages as needed to serve the needs of the MediaGuard customers. Profile, debug, optimize and harden Linux-based software. Support the development and delivery of the MediaGuard product, one of our flagship offerings that handles 1.5 trillion prediction requests a day from some of the largest internet companies in the world.

We will teach you Go! You have your share of war stories about distributed architectures and their common pitfalls You constantly aim for correctness and performance, in that order. You are a stickler for following a detailed merge request process and leaving things better than you found them. You look to find new and innovative ways to tackle sophisticated problems through detailed experimentation. You have an open attitude and collaborate well across team boundaries- be they the office hallway or the continental divide.

We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together!
   


 With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, with teams in London, Virginia, and Victoria, we trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The benefits package we provide reflects our remote-first culture and our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for home office setup, wellbeing, and learning & development.

Remote Junior Android Engineer;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=b03f15296375a5a2;Remote;yes;"REMOTE /ENGINEERING – DRIVE AXLE /ENGINEER

About us
Eleos Technologies is a growing 10-year-old company building communication software for truck drivers and field workers.
We’re helping a diverse mix of customers—from mom and pop operations to thousand-truck fleets—improve how they communicate with their employees by tackling information overload, reducing phone calls, and eliminating obsolete technologies.
Our engineering team has been 100% distributed since day one. This means we’re tooled up to handle product, architectural, technical, and ops work all from home or remote. You won’t miss out of office conversations, and you won’t have to learn to drive a telepresence robot.
We began life as a bootstrapped startup, which allowed us to focus on building products our customers love. Today, we're part of the Knight-Swift family, which has allowed us to keep our focus and the freedom to build the best products we can for the transportation industry. We offer robust healthcare (dental, medical, vision), paid time off, and a generous equipment budget.
About the role
Our app is more than the usual ""CRUD and chat"": in addition to industry-leading truck navigation and planning tools, we’ve got some advanced algorithms for identifying the best and safest vehicle route, document scanning, and more—all on the device.
Drive Axle is our consumer-facing document scanning app. We’re looking to scale up a team to invest further into this product and ship more advanced scanning capabilities, driver planning tools, and other features to make individual drivers’ lives easier.
As a member of our Drive Axle team, you’ll get to leave your mark on our consumer-facing app’s architecture, UI, and all the way down to the database and network guts. Our Android app is fully native, and we’re using a mix of Java and Kotlin. Since we’re a small team, you’ll have opportunities to review and work on web backend or frontend code in other languages outside the Android ecosystem, should you wish to do so.
Thousands of people across the country rely on our app to do their jobs, and we take quality seriously. We use a mixture of automated and manual testing to ensure each release is solid. You’ll write tests for your code, expand the existing automation, and work to both share and expand your skills around automated testing. We have CI that produces builds for the whole team to try within a few minutes of a commit or pull request being opened and a similar process for cutting release-ready builds for distribution.
About you
We're looking for a junior engineer who can help maintain, evolve, and improve our consumer-facing Android app, which is the single pane through which many of our users experience our core product.
You should be comfortable working with Android Studio, building views and activities, and managing network requests and state. You should have experience working with Java or Kotlin, but it's fine if you need to pick up the other one after you join the team. We also use a handful of other open-source and system libraries where they help, and we’ll help you learn to use those as you go.
We'd like someone who's both ready to teach others (you'll know things we don't!) and learn from co-workers in a fun, productive, and respectful environment.
Key skills
1+ years professional experience building or maintaining a shipping native Android app in Java or Kotlin (we've got some of each; new code is mostly Kotlin)
The ability to quickly convey ideas, opinions, and technical details in written English
Able to work 8-5 Eastern Standard Time ± 3 hours, to facilitate real time collaboration when needed
Not requirements, but things to mention if they apply to you
An app you've worked on is available in the Play Store
iOS app development experience
Experience writing JavaScript or Ruby
Rust, C++ or C skills
Image processing, GIS/mapping, fleet management, or computer vision experience
Technology
We take a “reasoned opinions, weakly held” approach to tools, and resist letting those tools define our identity. That said, we’ve had positive experiences with CircleCI, fastlane, SQLite, Google MLKit, and a bunch of other libraries that are mostly baked into the Android SDKs now.

On the backend, we've got Elixir, Erlang, and PostgreSQL all running in AWS.

Platform.sh is a groundbreaking hosting and development tool for web applications.

To reinforce our technical prowess, we are looking to grow our operations team. If you’re looking for an exciting, high-growth opportunity with an award-winning, cutting-edge company, this could be just the job for you

For its PaaS solution https://platform.sh is looking for an Operations and Service Reliability Engineer with a taste for Python and Go, great Linux system understanding, and a real hunger for the challenges of building robust, distributed systems.

Platform.sh is a PaaS shrouded in a lot of black magic (we can consistently clone a whole running cluster, with its state, databases, indexes in a matter of seconds). We want to get this down to the hundreds of milliseconds domain. Interested? There is more...

Our external API is pure Hypermedia REST + oAuth on top of Pyramid. It mechanizes the Git layer and needs more features.

We can consistently generate from the same manifest a Docker container, an LXC one, or VM disk images (AWS, Azure, OpenStack), we want more targets.

We probably have the highest industry container density. We need to get it higher.

We support any Python, Ruby, NodeJS or PHP, Java and .NET, time to roll-out Elixir, of course, Elixir (and Rust. We need Rust).

Directly reporting to one of our Directors for the Operations Infrastructure Department and in close interaction with our Engineering and Customer Success teams, you will be responsible for:

Cloud operations: configure clusters, deploy stuff, follow-up on alerts, help customer support debug issues
Automating all of the above so they can instead drink margaritas (or non-alcoholic beverages, of course)
Creating systems, tools & processes that will enhance our support and operations efficiency
Improving service quality, discipline and reliability throughout lifecycle
Monitoring operating objectives, streamline and automate intervention
Continuous learning from Operations experience, modeled as software

This is a fully remote position for a candidate based in the APAC timezone. Covering at least one day of the weekend is required, Saturday or/and Sunday.

The ideal candidate

Has proven successful experience in an operations role
Has demonstrated the ability to successfully manage cloud-based infrastructure for a fast growing organization
Has experience with containerization technologies
Has had exposure to cloud services such as AWS, Azure, GCP, etc
Understands how an OS works, knows networking, how git works, and the constraints of a distributed system,
Puppet experience
Is proficient in Python (Golang a plus)
Ability to cover weekends

Nice to have

Knowledge of Magento Ecommerce, Symfony, Drupal, eZ Platform, or Typo3

Note: we don't like stress, so we build everything to be robust and resilient, but stuff does break. This is a role with on-call duties and fire drills. If this fills you with dread... well, this might not be a fit for you.


A typical month in our team would look like this

Development week: writing the tools and automation to make our infrastructure run smoothly using Puppet, Go, Python, and more. We often find ourselves working on monitoring, self healing & upgrades.
Deploy week: there’s a constant need for increased capacity, and so we also handle the creation of new infrastructure, wherever and whenever needed.
Escalation week: when there's a problem too tough for our support team to solve, our team is called upon to provide assistance.
On-Call week: we dedicate one team member at a time to handle critical monitoring alerts from the infrastructure.


About Platform.sh

Platform.sh is an idea-to-cloud application platform that simplifies cloud infrastructures.

We give developers the tools they need to experiment, innovate, get rapid feedback and deliver better-quality features with speed and confidence thanks to our unique rapid cloning technology.

Platform.sh serves thousands of customers worldwide including The Financial Times, Gap, Magento Commerce, Orange, Hachette, Ikea, Stanford University, Harvard University, The British Council, and Lufthansa.

Software Engineer - Core Engine Internals;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=344733939e8e7637;San Francisco Bay Area, CA;no;"



    At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data. Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.
   


 Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, and past behaviors. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.
   


 As a Core Engine Internals Engineer, you'll help us shape the future of the Sisu Engine - a parallel, distributed, cloud-native dataflow engine for high performance ML model execution, written in Rust. We're looking for database internals engineers experienced with query planning and optimization, access methods, and data layout. You'll play a critical role in helping us advance the performance and efficiency of our system—both with low-level optimizations, such as honing concurrency and reducing memory allocations, as well as high-level architecture, such as maximizing distributed computing throughput and scheduling work fairly. Your contributions to the speed and scalability of our system will directly go into one of the key differentiators for our product against the status quo. Success in this area will be the foundation on which future Sisu features depend.
   



Responsibilities 

Design, engineer, and operate Sisu's scalable parallel data processing engine, including distributed query processing, columnar execution, and streaming updates Develop novel and scalable systems combining hardware-accelerated data processing with machine learning and statistical hypothesis testing Technical leadership Shape the engineering culture through mentorship Build out our data plane Implement new analyses in our performance-critical data processing engine Optimize and scale data ingest and workload distribution Actively participate in customer POCs to optimize customer experience and adoption. Work collaboratively with multiple departments such as Sales, Marketing, and G&A.





Key Qualifications

 A passion for database systems, storage systems, distributed systems, and/or performance optimization Substantial experience building production-grade data-intensive systems, especially database internals and/or large-scale parallel data processing systems internals Substantial experience in low-level systems programming, including but not limited to SIMD vectorization, memory management, and general mechanical sympathy Strong understanding of data-related CS fundamentals including distributed systems and distributed computing, fault tolerance and consensus protocols, and query optimization Strong interest in or production experience writing large-scale systems in Rust Optional: PhD in databases or distributed systems

For its PaaS solution https://platform.sh is looking for an Operations and Service Reliability Engineer with a taste for Python and Go, great Linux system understanding, and a real hunger for the challenges of building robust, distributed systems.

Platform.sh is a PaaS shrouded in a lot of black magic (we can consistently clone a whole running cluster, with its state, databases, indexes in a matter of seconds). We want to get this down to the hundreds of milliseconds domain. Interested? There is more...

Our external API is pure Hypermedia REST + oAuth on top of Pyramid. It mechanizes the Git layer and needs more features.

We can consistently generate from the same manifest a Docker container, an LXC one, or VM disk images (AWS, Azure, OpenStack), we want more targets.

We probably have the highest industry container density. We need to get it higher.

We support any Python, Ruby, NodeJS or PHP, Java and .NET, time to roll-out Elixir, of course, Elixir (and Rust. We need Rust).

Directly reporting to one of our Directors for the Operations Infrastructure Department and in close interaction with our Engineering and Customer Success teams, you will be responsible for:

Cloud operations: configure clusters, deploy stuff, follow-up on alerts, help customer support debug issues
Automating all of the above so they can instead drink margaritas (or non-alcoholic beverages, of course)
Creating systems, tools & processes that will enhance our support and operations efficiency
Improving service quality, discipline and reliability throughout lifecycle
Monitoring operating objectives, streamline and automate intervention
Continuous learning from Operations experience, modeled as software

This is a fully remote position for a candidate based in the APAC timezone. Covering at least one day of the weekend is required, Saturday or/and Sunday.

The ideal candidate

Has proven successful experience in an operations role
Has demonstrated the ability to successfully manage cloud-based infrastructure for a fast growing organization
Has experience with containerization technologies
Has had exposure to cloud services such as AWS, Azure, GCP, etc
Understands how an OS works, knows networking, how git works, and the constraints of a distributed system,
Puppet experience
Is proficient in Python (Golang a plus)
Ability to cover weekends

Nice to have

Knowledge of Magento Ecommerce, Symfony, Drupal, eZ Platform, or Typo3

Note: we don't like stress, so we build everything to be robust and resilient, but stuff does break. This is a role with on-call duties and fire drills. If this fills you with dread... well, this might not be a fit for you.


A typical month in our team would look like this

Development week: writing the tools and automation to make our infrastructure run smoothly using Puppet, Go, Python, and more. We often find ourselves working on monitoring, self healing & upgrades.
Deploy week: there’s a constant need for increased capacity, and so we also handle the creation of new infrastructure, wherever and whenever needed.
Escalation week: when there's a problem too tough for our support team to solve, our team is called upon to provide assistance.
On-Call week: we dedicate one team member at a time to handle critical monitoring alerts from the infrastructure.


About Platform.sh

Platform.sh is an idea-to-cloud application platform that simplifies cloud infrastructures.

We give developers the tools they need to experiment, innovate, get rapid feedback and deliver better-quality features with speed and confidence thanks to our unique rapid cloning technology.

Software Engineer - Core Engine Internals;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=344733939e8e7637;San Francisco Bay Area, CA;no;"



    At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data. Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.
   


 Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, and past behaviors. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.
   


 As a Core Engine Internals Engineer, you'll help us shape the future of the Sisu Engine - a parallel, distributed, cloud-native dataflow engine for high performance ML model execution, written in Rust. We're looking for database internals engineers experienced with query planning and optimization, access methods, and data layout. You'll play a critical role in helping us advance the performance and efficiency of our system—both with low-level optimizations, such as honing concurrency and reducing memory allocations, as well as high-level architecture, such as maximizing distributed computing throughput and scheduling work fairly. Your contributions to the speed and scalability of our system will directly go into one of the key differentiators for our product against the status quo. Success in this area will be the foundation on which future Sisu features depend.
   



Responsibilities 

Design, engineer, and operate Sisu's scalable parallel data processing engine, including distributed query processing, columnar execution, and streaming updates Develop novel and scalable systems combining hardware-accelerated data processing with machine learning and statistical hypothesis testing Technical leadership Shape the engineering culture through mentorship Build out our data plane Implement new analyses in our performance-critical data processing engine Optimize and scale data ingest and workload distribution Actively participate in customer POCs to optimize customer experience and adoption. Work collaboratively with multiple departments such as Sales, Marketing, and G&A.





Key Qualifications

 A passion for database systems, storage systems, distributed systems, and/or performance optimization Substantial experience building production-grade data-intensive systems, especially database internals and/or large-scale parallel data processing systems internals Substantial experience in low-level systems programming, including but not limited to SIMD vectorization, memory management, and general mechanical sympathy Strong understanding of data-related CS fundamentals including distributed systems and distributed computing, fault tolerance and consensus protocols, and query optimization Strong interest in or production experience writing large-scale systems in Rust Optional: PhD in databases or distributed systems

Safe concurrency. Knowing patterns for working with concurrent code safely is critically important for our applications
Cross-platform code. Our customers use many different platforms, so we know the difference between compiling with GCC vs Clang vs MSVC and when to utilize the JVM or web technology
Our code runs on devices that people work with and wear in heterogeneous processing hardware under unique resource constraints. This also means we employ multiple strategies to test our code from automated unit testing to device emulation and field testing
Putting math to work. Our products are often born from research projects which means learning and applying advanced math is how we deliver to our customers

Software Engineering Manager;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=56cf980f45f3d514;Oklahoma City, OK 73112 (Adventure District area);no;"Our mission at Tailwind is to make world-class marketing easy for everyone.

We’re getting there by bringing first-of-its-kind software to small businesses worldwide that helps them execute digital marketing campaigns AND aims to do as much marketing legwork as possible.

With over 1 million Tailwind users, we’re off to a good start - but we have a long way to go in product development, market penetration, and company building to reach as many of the over 200+ million small businesses out there as possible. That’s where you come in...

We're looking for an engineering manager with a proven track record of leading multiple small software development teams (squads). You must have experience developing (i.e. have spent 5+ number of years coding and architecting) and delivering SAAS systems, excellent people and project management skills. In this role you will be managing and working directly with the lead engineer on each squad to plan and execute our agile iterations ensuring we ship software continuously, efficiently, and with excellent quality.

What you’ll do…

Provide hands-on technical leadership within the product development squads — ensuring the team plans, develops, and ships (through CI/CD) features with excellent quality at a high pace and efficiency.
Coordinate iterations and workstreams (epics) with product managers, designers, UX researchers, and engineers on the squads to ensure we’re delivering timely value to our customers following our roadmap.
Share your knowledge across the team and encourage others to do the same — through documentation, presentations, lunch & learns, live demos, blog posts, etc.
Help our engineers succeed and become better engineers. You’ll be holding regular one on ones, unblocking projects, and helping solve technical problems as they arise. You will also have administrative and people management responsibilities such as annual goal-setting, establishing career growth trajectories, conducting performance evaluations, etc.
Help us hire top-notch engineers and scale the team to keep our products and company growing.

Foster a culture of iterating quickly with continuous deployment, monitoring, and constant improvement. We believe that constant progress and testing is better than waiting for perfection.
Work closely with our Platform Engineering manager to coordinate efforts and execute the work on iterations and workstreams that require building or implementing new technology, new services, new infrastructure footprint, new architectural patterns that require collaboration in order to tackle the level of complexity involved.
Work closely with the VP of Engineering and Platform Engineering Manager to establish and execute the technical roadmap for architecture, engineering practices and processes.

About you…

Experienced: You have relevant software engineering experience (specifically full-stack web development) building products while architecting simple solutions to complex problems, and have led development teams through multiple product life cycles (greenfield start, development, launch, enhancement and maintenance).

Technical: You have the technical depth to not only define a high-level architecture but are comfortable diving in as a contributor with the same level of expertise as the developers on the team.

Coaching and coachable: You enjoy coaching and teaching a team. At the same time, you also absorb data and feedback easily to improve and adapt quickly. You default to teaching people how to learn on their own, rather than telling them what to do.

Flexible: You focus on using the best tool for the job without bias, embrace the full-stack infrastructure, and aren’t afraid to switch between languages/platforms as needed (even if it means learning them).

Agile: You’re comfortable working in an agile development environment, where requirements and goals might rapidly evolve as we learn from our users.
Embracing cross-team collaboration: You want to be on a team that’s radically collaborative, free of silos, where engineers work in partnership with team members from across the company (product, design, customer success, marketing).

Domain knowledge: You have strong opinions — well informed, but loosely held — on languages, platforms, and workflow tools.
You love data.
Problem-solving: You have exceptional analytical skills, are an out-of-the-box thinker, and are comfortable with quickly learning, evaluating, and deploying new technologies - even in ambiguous situations.
Constant learning: You’re always learning patterns, practices, and tools to improve your and the team’s development experience - including being involved in the dev community. You may have side projects too.
Versatile: You’re comfortable writing front-end components, unit-testing a back-end endpoint or anything in between.


Bonus points for experience in:

Data-driven applications handling large volumes (Terabytes) of data
Creating and scaling RESTful APIs
Knowledge of product design / UX
Open Source contributions
Programming languages versatility Typescript, Rust, Java, Python, Go, etc.
Extensive database experience (Cassandra, MongoDB, RedShift, etc.)
Mobile development experience (React Native, iOS, Android)
Distributed architectures and cloud services
Dev-Ops tools (logging, monitoring, cloud infrastructure provisioning)
Big Data stack (Hadoop, MapReduce, Hive, HBase, Pig)
Data Science, Machine Learning: scikit-learn, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.

About our engineering approach...

Our development workflow is constantly evolving, with the goal of keeping it as organic (i.e. invisible) as possible with a few constants: Practicing Lean Methodology — build, measure, learn, iterate, and making data-driven decisions inside agile sprints.

Customer and innovation-focused: Engineers are intimately involved in the product development and decision-making, from having direct access to our customers for research to roadmap discussions, implementation, testing, shipping, measuring, iteration, etc.

Lots of team collaboration: Innovation should come from any team member, and absolutely not just from “the top.” Best practices are widely communicated and expected. Pair programming is valued. Every piece of code gets reviewed before merging into the master.

Our technology stack:

You’ll need to have production experience with at least some of our technologies, frameworks, and languages. Or at a minimum - similar ones that will help you learn and start contributing quickly.

Front-end: Typescript, Next.js, React
Back-end: Typescript on AWS lambdas, some PHP7
Testing: Jest, Playwright
Database: DynamoDB, MariaDB
Version Control: Git
CICD: Github Actions
IDEs: VSCode, PHPStorm
DevOps: ELK (ElasticSearch, LogStash, Kibana), New Relic, Indicative Analytics
Hosting: AWS, Rackspace (dedicated DB + virtual servers)
Agile Communication: Clubhouse, Slack, and Github

    ocV!BE Digital Experience Design (DxD) is an embedded creative technology team that helps radically transform places into futuristic experiences with integrity and resonance. As we continue to expand and diversify our portfolio with the development of the ocV!BE project, it becomes increasingly important to have subject matter experts to help lead this exciting effort. Reporting directly to the Director of Software Engineering, the Senior Web Developer serves as a vital member of this team, playing a significant role and responsible for supporting the operationalization of software engineering and associated product design work via clear resource planning and progress/process management. This role will assist in the build-out of the department, including the establishment of systems, setting up group-wide processes and governance, determining the culture, and implementing technologies to support the efficiency and effectiveness of ocV!BE DxD functions and other key activities essential to building a nimble, smart, collaborative, and highly effective team.

 This is accomplished via omnipresent, immersive, timely, relevant, and friction-reducing content
 Delivering these solutions requires cutting edge experience, data, and content management platforms that are built by people who understand the nature of experience design and focus just as much on the end audience experience as the Litehouse user experience

 Orchestrating technologies, teams, and workflows (which to date have been disparate and fragmented), should solve for the complexities of myriad technologies and workflows within a single platform
 Litehouse’s flexibility is finite; Litehouse can interconnect and orchestrate virtually any system or process and does so in a standardized way that is repeatable/scalable
 Litehouse solutions are built by analyzing the nature of the work of experts and embedding that expertise within components of the Litehouse platform
 Litehouse empowers users to focus on their vision, delivering confidence that their tools will supplement and expand upon their own capabilities

 Who is SpiderOak?
 We want to change the world, and we’ve already done it once. SpiderOak has been building encrypted software since before the first iPhone was released.
 SpiderOak is committed to building secure and reliable software that protects our customers’ data. Our approach is fundamentally different from most mainstream security companies. Instead of adding layers of security on top of an insecure system, we build software that is inherently secure.

Traditional systems trust IT infrastructure to maintain the whole security system, even though the news is rife with evidence that this model does not work. Our software combines end to end encryption with a distributed ledger (aka Blockchain) technology to offer best-in-class security with no backdoors.

 The Elevator Pitch: Why would you enjoy this new opportunity?
 Are you looking for a startup-like experience? Are you curious to explore and learn a large range of technologies? Join us to incubate technology-forward products and services!

 Job Opportunity in VMware Incubation and Innovation Partnerships Group
 The VMware Incubation and Innovation Partnerships group seeks to hire talented software engineers who will help incubate new business opportunities based on cutting-edge research ideas in the modern data platforms area. These research ideas, initially explored in VMware’s internal research group and/or our academic collaborations, are matured into new product offerings via VMware Research Translation (vRTX, pronounced “vortex”) projects. Typically, vRTX projects run for up to three years and develop software artifacts (technology previews, proofs of concept, minimum viable products) that illuminate the advantages of early-stage research ideas and serve as vehicles for collaboration with potential customers to assess product/market fit.

 vRTX software engineers must have exceptional software development abilities, and a desire to learn and work with different technologies in a short period of time. Projects may pivot more frequently than roadmap products, and intensive customer interactions can put a high premium on rapid prototyping skills. The ability to work effectively with customer engineering teams on POCs is important. Teams are usually small, so versatility and teamwork are essential.

 You may participate in customer meetings to understand use cases and requirements.
 You may participate in advanced development activities within VMware or in universities to advance the state of the art.
 You may participate in POCs and customer interactions together with our customer engineering teams.
 You may develop micro-services and expect to deploy them in a public cloud.


 The Work: What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis?

 Project-specific technical areas including distributed systems, key-value. databases, and the integration of these components in modern big data ingest and processing pipelines.
 Production-level coding experience in C, C++, and Java.
 Experience and demonstrated success in advanced development and/or research project implementation.
 Engineering systems for high concurrency and many-core scaling.
 Modern storage-related data structures and algorithms.


 Preferred Qualifications

 Experience with emerging technologies related to storage, such as pmem and NVMe.
 Experience creating SaaS database or data processing systems.
 Experience benchmarking and optimizing data systems.
 Experience developing data planes for SaaS services.
 Exposure to multiple programming languages is important, as the ability to pick up and use the language that suits a body of work is expected.
 Experience in a range of system programming languages beyond C and Java (e.g., Rust.)
 Master’s (preferred) or bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with comparable work experience.
 PhD in a relevant specialty would be a positive credential.

    At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data. Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.
   


 Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, and past behaviors. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.
   


 As a Software Engineer, you’ll have the opportunity to shape the future of the Sisu Engine - a query processor that is optimized for hypothesis testing at a large scale with speeds of millions of records faster than any other system. You’ll have the opportunity to work on challenging technical problems combining data management, machine learning, distributed systems and develop key features that can be attributed to only a handful of engineers.
   



Responsibilities

 Design, engineer, and operate Sisu's scalable parallel data processing engine, including distributed query processing, columnar execution, and streaming updates Develop novel and scalable systems combining hardware-accelerated data processing with machine learning and statistical hypothesis testing Technical leadership Shape the engineering culture through mentorship Build out our data plane Implement new analyses in our performance-critical data processing engine Optimize and scale data ingest and workload distribution Actively participate in customer POCs to optimize customer experience and adoption. Work collaboratively with multiple departments such as Sales, Marketing, and G&A.





Preferred Qualifications

 Fluency with a manual memory-managed language (C++, C, etc.) OR Rust Background in database internals or building core components for data processing systems (query compilation, query execution, storage engines, transaction processing) Strong CS fundamentals including data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems.

Build something from day one that would be immediately deployed in the real world. Imagine being able to tell your grandkids one day that you helped put some of the first robots on Canadian's sidewalks.  About the job 
    At Tiny Mile, We are excited and strongly believe that putting robots in the streets of Canada would solve the last mile delivery problem. A category defining moment in the last mile delivery where we make it sustainable, ecological and affordable for our customers providing a safe and contactless delivery option. 
We are looking for a software engineer which will impact us from day one. This person will help us write software that enables us to ingest orders from different point of sale systems, assign the orders to specific robots and help us track and visualize all the data created by our robots to keep them healthy. Furthermore, a UI which controls robots remotely(How cool is that!?). 
Our team consists of a diverse group of people coming from all walks of life. People from Uber ATG, some have built billion dollars robotics companies. Others, are people who come from quirky backgrounds who loves robotics. 
We're backed by amazing investors who believe in our team going after a huge market. We're about to hit an inflection point in our company. We're ready to grow again. Come pick a seat in our rocket ship and strap on. We're about to take off.  Why it matters 
   
Last-mile is the highest polluting segment. Given the continuous rise of e-commerce, it is expected the total carbon emissions will increase 30% by 2030 because of the last-mile. Our robots not only have zero emissions but use as little electricity as a light bulb.
People spend on average 10 hours running errands, going grocery, etc each week. If delivery was reliable, instantaneous and cost cents it would free people from carrying these tasks. If there are 2.93 million people in Toronto, we would be giving back 29.3 million hours to people to spend with their families and what they care about.
Imagine a small bookstore delivering their books for cents to the entire city in half an hour or less. Transportation has always been the backbone of the economy and delivery robots will ease trade and foster unprecedented economic growth.
During this pandemic, we are helping keep small businesses in business while also keeping their customers safe.
What you'll build 
   
Real time monitoring, we want to be able to instantly jump on a robot when something is not going well and control it.
Everything related to dispatching of orders. This is getting orders pushed from the restaurants, and assigned to the best available robot.
Build tools to make sure the fleet is working as expected and alert us when something goes wrong.
User interfaces to drive our robots from anywhere in the world!
Who you are 
   
Enthusiastic about robots.
Love learning and experimenting with new things and applying them quickly.
Have a backbone. We want someone to stand by ideas backed with data.
Have 3+ years of engineering experience.
Have worked with CI/CD pipelines and version control.
Experience in deploying code to cloud platforms while following Infra-as-Code principles
Nice to haves 
   
Knowing Golang/C/C++/Rust is a plus.
Interest and ability to learn other coding languages as needed.
Front-end experience
Worked or experimented with functional languages
Deployed and managed Kubernetes clusters and workloads
Why You’ll Love Working at Tiny Mile 
   
We are customer-obsessed - Our mission is to reduce the last mile cost. In addition, provide excellent customer service, ecologically, sustainably and affordably.
We think big - Putting robots in the streets is no easy feat. We work towards that, which means every day we get to invent and experiment with new ways on how to achieve that.
We are learners and doers - We never stop learning and implement new knowledge in our company. Always open to new ideas backed with good data. We're open to giving our team members room to grow.
We are Tiny Milers - We are ok in ambiguity. Have a bias for action. Collaborative in nature. Lastly, we strive for the highest standards.
What You'll Get From Us 
   
Come as you are and harness your full potential.
Challenging problems to solve that leverage your already expertise in engineering.
Be part of a group where you do impactful work. Putting robots in the streets is no easy feat.
Competitive compensation: Salary between USD 50.000,00 and USD 150.000,00

The Elevator Pitch: Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?

 Join our team of Software Engineers who help customers build and improve their software! We do this through a dedication to Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, and Clean Code concepts. We also encourage our clients to create an environment conducive to high-performing teams and engaged employees.

 The people who succeed at Tanzu Labs are excited to learn and help others learn constantly. As consultants, we sometimes work in business domains or tech stacks unfamiliar to us, but we can achieve exceptional results through excellent software writing processes.

 Tanzu Labs is routinely on the cutting edge, using emergent technologies while alternately excavating heritage mainframes. You will have the opportunity to leverage a range of tools and technologies, from common skills like Java/Spring, C#/.NET, and Typescript/React, iOS or Android, or using Rust or Go for WebAssembly on Kubernetes.

 Success in the Role: What are the performance outcomes over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing?


 Day 1 - meet your peers and learn how to improve your craft as an engineer and consultant.
 Week 1 - learn how you can contribute to the health and growth of our engineering practice.
 Month 1 - join a client-facing team. You will build and modernize valuable custom software using modern engineering best practices.
 Quarter 1 - you will have made amazing improvements to your engineering skills! You will feel comfortable helping less experienced client engineers build great software.
 Year 1 - you will feel comfortable leading the efforts of an engineering team! You will deliver fantastic software and make a lasting impact on the software skills of customers.


 The Work: What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis?
 Your regular activities may be modified to suit your professional strengths, but you can expect a variety of the following assignments:

 Be a crucial member of a team dedicated to helping a single customer achieve their technical and product goals. Build and modernize custom software built the right way.
 Advocate for modern best practices like Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, Refactoring, and Domain Driven Design.
 Collaborate daily with client engineers and stakeholders to solve complex problems in uncertain environments using a combination of their domain knowledge and your skills as an engineer. Coach customers on our approach all along the way!
 Learn new technologies to help a wide range of customers.
 Collaborate with product managers and designers to find simpler ways to meet the needs of our customer’s users and business.
 Learn new skills and grow in your own career while contributing learnings back to others in our Engineering practice so we can all grow and thrive together.


 ****This position will perform work that the U.S. government has specified can only be performed by a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, and therefore any offer will be contingent upon verification of both of these requirements.****

 What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?
 We believe in collaborative, autonomous teams focused on achieving our customer’s goals. Our leadership strives to create a healthy environment for you to do your best work and will empower you to work directly with your team and clients to deliver.

 Your manager will be an experienced Software Engineer, Product Manager, or Designer. They will support your growth through training, mentorship, and stretch opportunities. You should expect regular 1:1 meetings with your manager that are focused on project support and career planning.

 We are passionate about building valuable software and software teams set up for long term success.

We have learned that being empathetic, inclusive, and kind empowers people to achieve greatness. We look forward to welcoming new team members!

 Where is this role located?
 Like many companies, the COVID pandemic changed how we work. We are fortunate to be capable of running a strong business with some remote flexibility.

 However, we believe that the fastest way to build authentic relationships is in person. Our role as consultants requires us to work well with new teammates on many types of engagements. We navigate large customer organizations, facilitate team building and work towards shared goals. We’ve found that we can do this remotely, but it is faster when we are co-located. Kicking off customer engagements in-person also fosters happier and more productive remote days. Once the pandemic is behind us, we expect in-person collaboration at one of our offices or at the customer's site which may require travel of 10-25%.

Software Engineer Public Sector: Austin - Opportunity for Wo...;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=2b0826ef22f564d0;Austin, TX;yes;"


The Elevator Pitch: Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?

 Join our team of Software Engineers who help customers build and improve their software! We do this through a dedication to Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, and Clean Code concepts. We also encourage our clients to create an environment conducive to high-performing teams and engaged employees.

 The people who succeed at Tanzu Labs are excited to learn and help others learn constantly. As consultants, we sometimes work in business domains or tech stacks unfamiliar to us, but we can achieve exceptional results through excellent software writing processes.

 Tanzu Labs is routinely on the cutting edge, using emergent technologies while alternately excavating heritage mainframes. You will have the opportunity to leverage a range of tools and technologies, from common skills like Java/Spring, C#/.NET, and Typescript/React, iOS or Android, or using Rust or Go for WebAssembly on Kubernetes.

 Success in the Role: What are the performance outcomes over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing?


 Day 1 - meet your peers and learn how to improve your craft as an engineer and consultant.
 Week 1 - learn how you can contribute to the health and growth of our engineering practice.
 Month 1 - join a client-facing team. You will build and modernize valuable custom software using modern engineering best practices.
 Quarter 1 - you will have made amazing improvements to your engineering skills! You will feel comfortable helping less experienced client engineers build great software.
 Year 1 - you will feel comfortable leading the efforts of an engineering team! You will deliver fantastic software and make a lasting impact on the software skills of customers.


 The Work: What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis?
 Your regular activities may be modified to suit your professional strengths, but you can expect a variety of the following assignments:

 Be a crucial member of a team dedicated to helping a single customer achieve their technical and product goals. Build and modernize custom software built the right way.
 Advocate for modern best practices like Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, Refactoring, and Domain Driven Design.
 Collaborate daily with client engineers and stakeholders to solve complex problems in uncertain environments using a combination of their domain knowledge and your skills as an engineer. Coach customers on our approach all along the way!
 Learn new technologies to help a wide range of customers.
 Collaborate with product managers and designers to find simpler ways to meet the needs of our customer’s users and business.
 Learn new skills and grow in your own career while contributing learnings back to others in our Engineering practice so we can all grow and thrive together.


 ****This position will perform work that the U.S. government has specified can only be performed by a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, and therefore any offer will be contingent upon verification of both of these requirements.****

 What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?
 We believe in collaborative, autonomous teams focused on achieving our customer’s goals. Our leadership strives to create a healthy environment for you to do your best work and will empower you to work directly with your team and clients to deliver.

 Your manager will be an experienced Software Engineer, Product Manager, or Designer. They will support your growth through training, mentorship, and stretch opportunities. You should expect regular 1:1 meetings with your manager that are focused on project support and career planning.

 We are passionate about building valuable software and software teams set up for long term success. We strive to leave every client team better than we found it and love collaborating along this exciting journey. We have a bias towards action and love to test ideas so we can learn and improve. We have learned that being empathetic, inclusive, and kind empowers people to achieve greatness. We look forward to welcoming new team members!

 Where is this role located?
 Like many companies, the COVID pandemic changed how we work. We are fortunate to be capable of running a strong business with some remote flexibility.

 However, we believe that the fastest way to build authentic relationships is in person. Our role as consultants requires us to work well with new teammates on many types of engagements. We navigate large customer organizations, facilitate team building and work towards shared goals. We’ve found that we can do this remotely, but it is faster when we are co-located. Kicking off customer engagements in-person also fosters happier and more productive remote days. Once the pandemic is behind us, we expect in-person collaboration at one of our offices or at the customer's site which may require travel of 10-25%.

Software Engineering Manager;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=56cf980f45f3d514;Oklahoma City, OK 73112 (Adventure District area);no;"Our mission at Tailwind is to make world-class marketing easy for everyone.

We’re getting there by bringing first-of-its-kind software to small businesses worldwide that helps them execute digital marketing campaigns AND aims to do as much marketing legwork as possible.

With over 1 million Tailwind users, we’re off to a good start - but we have a long way to go in product development, market penetration, and company building to reach as many of the over 200+ million small businesses out there as possible. That’s where you come in...

We're looking for an engineering manager with a proven track record of leading multiple small software development teams (squads). You must have experience developing (i.e. have spent 5+ number of years coding and architecting) and delivering SAAS systems, excellent people and project management skills. In this role you will be managing and working directly with the lead engineer on each squad to plan and execute our agile iterations ensuring we ship software continuously, efficiently, and with excellent quality.

What you’ll do…

Provide hands-on technical leadership within the product development squads — ensuring the team plans, develops, and ships (through CI/CD) features with excellent quality at a high pace and efficiency.
Coordinate iterations and workstreams (epics) with product managers, designers, UX researchers, and engineers on the squads to ensure we’re delivering timely value to our customers following our roadmap.
Share your knowledge across the team and encourage others to do the same — through documentation, presentations, lunch & learns, live demos, blog posts, etc.
Help our engineers succeed and become better engineers. You’ll be holding regular one on ones, unblocking projects, and helping solve technical problems as they arise. You will also have administrative and people management responsibilities such as annual goal-setting, establishing career growth trajectories, conducting performance evaluations, etc.
Help us hire top-notch engineers and scale the team to keep our products and company growing.

Foster a culture of iterating quickly with continuous deployment, monitoring, and constant improvement. We believe that constant progress and testing is better than waiting for perfection.
Work closely with our Platform Engineering manager to coordinate efforts and execute the work on iterations and workstreams that require building or implementing new technology, new services, new infrastructure footprint, new architectural patterns that require collaboration in order to tackle the level of complexity involved.
Work closely with the VP of Engineering and Platform Engineering Manager to establish and execute the technical roadmap for architecture, engineering practices and processes.

About you…

Experienced: You have relevant software engineering experience (specifically full-stack web development) building products while architecting simple solutions to complex problems, and have led development teams through multiple product life cycles (greenfield start, development, launch, enhancement and maintenance).

Technical: You have the technical depth to not only define a high-level architecture but are comfortable diving in as a contributor with the same level of expertise as the developers on the team.

Coaching and coachable: You enjoy coaching and teaching a team. At the same time, you also absorb data and feedback easily to improve and adapt quickly. You default to teaching people how to learn on their own, rather than telling them what to do.

Flexible: You focus on using the best tool for the job without bias, embrace the full-stack infrastructure, and aren’t afraid to switch between languages/platforms as needed (even if it means learning them).

Agile: You’re comfortable working in an agile development environment, where requirements and goals might rapidly evolve as we learn from our users.
Embracing cross-team collaboration: You want to be on a team that’s radically collaborative, free of silos, where engineers work in partnership with team members from across the company (product, design, customer success, marketing).

Domain knowledge: You have strong opinions — well informed, but loosely held — on languages, platforms, and workflow tools.
You love data.
Problem-solving: You have exceptional analytical skills, are an out-of-the-box thinker, and are comfortable with quickly learning, evaluating, and deploying new technologies - even in ambiguous situations.
Constant learning: You’re always learning patterns, practices, and tools to improve your and the team’s development experience - including being involved in the dev community. You may have side projects too.
Versatile: You’re comfortable writing front-end components, unit-testing a back-end endpoint or anything in between.


Bonus points for experience in:

Data-driven applications handling large volumes (Terabytes) of data
Creating and scaling RESTful APIs
Knowledge of product design / UX
Open Source contributions
Programming languages versatility Typescript, Rust, Java, Python, Go, etc.
Extensive database experience (Cassandra, MongoDB, RedShift, etc.)
Mobile development experience (React Native, iOS, Android)
Distributed architectures and cloud services
Dev-Ops tools (logging, monitoring, cloud infrastructure provisioning)
Big Data stack (Hadoop, MapReduce, Hive, HBase, Pig)
Data Science, Machine Learning: scikit-learn, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.

About our engineering approach...

Our development workflow is constantly evolving, with the goal of keeping it as organic (i.e. invisible) as possible with a few constants: Practicing Lean Methodology — build, measure, learn, iterate, and making data-driven decisions inside agile sprints.

Customer and innovation-focused: Engineers are intimately involved in the product development and decision-making, from having direct access to our customers for research to roadmap discussions, implementation, testing, shipping, measuring, iteration, etc.

Lots of team collaboration: Innovation should come from any team member, and absolutely not just from “the top.” Best practices are widely communicated and expected. Pair programming is valued. Every piece of code gets reviewed before merging into the master.

Our technology stack:

You’ll need to have production experience with at least some of our technologies, frameworks, and languages. Or at a minimum - similar ones that will help you learn and start contributing quickly.

Front-end: Typescript, Next.js, React
Back-end: Typescript on AWS lambdas, some PHP7
Testing: Jest, Playwright
Database: DynamoDB, MariaDB
Version Control: Git
CICD: Github Actions
IDEs: VSCode, PHPStorm

Reporting directly to the Director of Software Engineering, the UI/Web Senior Software Product Engineer serves as a vital member of this team, playing a significant role and responsible for designing and implementing intelligent and efficient UIs. This role will assist in the build-out of the department, including the establishment of systems, setting up group-wide processes and governance, determining the culture, and implementing technologies to support the efficiency and effectiveness of ocV!BE DxD functions and other key activities essential to building a nimble, smart, collaborative, and highly effective team.

 Success means that modern, sophisticated audiences - with a plethora of choices and deep concerns about privacy - are attracted, converted, and retained
 This is accomplished via omnipresent, immersive, timely, relevant, and friction-reducing content
 Delivering these solutions requires cutting edge experience, data, and content management platforms that are built by people who understand the nature of experience design and focus just as much on the end audience experience as the Litehouse user experience
 Orchestrating technologies, teams, and workflows (which to date have been disparate and fragmented), should solve for the complexities of myriad technologies and workflows within a single platform
 Litehouse’s flexibility is finite; Litehouse can interconnect and orchestrate virtually any system or process and does so in a standardized way that is repeatable/scalable
 Litehouse solutions are built by analyzing the nature of the work of experts and embedding that expertise within components of the Litehouse platform
 Litehouse empowers users to focus on their vision, delivering confidence that their tools will supplement and expand upon their own capabilities

HUMAN was founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore by Tamer Hassan, Michael Tiffany, Dan Kaminsky, and Ash Kalb. Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Verification Engine, the backbone of all our products that protect enterprises from sophisticated bots. Today we verify the humanity of more than 15 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms across the internet.
   


 Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to helping protect companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by malicious bots. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first.

We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).

Our team consists of a diverse group of people coming from all walks of life. People from Uber ATG, some have built billion dollars robotics companies. Others, are people who come from quirky backgrounds who loves robotics. 
We're backed by amazing investors who believe in our team going after a huge market. We're about to hit an inflection point in our company. We're ready to grow again. Come pick a seat in our rocket ship and strap on. We're about to take off.  Why it matters 
   
Last-mile is the highest polluting segment. Given the continuous rise of e-commerce, it is expected the total carbon emissions will increase 30% by 2030 because of the last-mile. Our robots not only have zero emissions but use as little electricity as a light bulb.
People spend on average 10 hours running errands, going grocery, etc each week. If delivery was reliable, instantaneous and cost cents it would free people from carrying these tasks. If there are 2.93 million people in Toronto, we would be giving back 29.3 million hours to people to spend with their families and what they care about.
Imagine a small bookstore delivering their books for cents to the entire city in half an hour or less. Transportation has always been the backbone of the economy and delivery robots will ease trade and foster unprecedented economic growth.
During this pandemic, we are helping keep small businesses in business while also keeping their customers safe.
What you'll build 
   
Real time monitoring, we want to be able to instantly jump on a robot when something is not going well and control it.
Everything related to dispatching of orders. This is getting orders pushed from the restaurants, and assigned to the best available robot.
Build tools to make sure the fleet is working as expected and alert us when something goes wrong.
User interfaces to drive our robots from anywhere in the world!
Who you are 
   
Enthusiastic about robots.
Love learning and experimenting with new things and applying them quickly.
Have a backbone. We want someone to stand by ideas backed with data.
Have 3+ years of engineering experience.
Have worked with CI/CD pipelines and version control.
Experience in deploying code to cloud platforms while following Infra-as-Code principles
Nice to haves 
   
Knowing Golang/C/C++/Rust is a plus.
Interest and ability to learn other coding languages as needed.
Front-end experience
Worked or experimented with functional languages
Deployed and managed Kubernetes clusters and workloads
Why You’ll Love Working at Tiny Mile 
   
We are customer-obsessed - Our mission is to reduce the last mile cost. In addition, provide excellent customer service, ecologically, sustainably and affordably.
We think big - Putting robots in the streets is no easy feat. We work towards that, which means every day we get to invent and experiment with new ways on how to achieve that.
We are learners and doers - We never stop learning and implement new knowledge in our company. Always open to new ideas backed with good data. We're open to giving our team members room to grow.
We are Tiny Milers - We are ok in ambiguity. Have a bias for action. Collaborative in nature. Lastly, we strive for the highest standards.
What You'll Get From Us 
   
Come as you are and harness your full potential.
Challenging problems to solve that leverage your already expertise in engineering.
Be part of a group where you do impactful work. Putting robots in the streets is no easy feat.

Senior Software Engineer - Platform & Infrastructure;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=9b4eaff31a46c255;San Francisco Bay Area, CA;no;"



    At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data. Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.
   


 Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, and past behaviors. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.
   


 As a Senior Software Engineer, you’ll have the opportunity to shape the future of the Sisu Engine - a query processor that is optimized for hypothesis testing at a large scale with speeds of millions of records faster than any other system. You’ll have the opportunity to work on challenging technical problems combining data management, machine learning, distributed systems and develop key features that can be attributed to only a handful of engineers.
   



Responsibilities

 Design, engineer, and operate Sisu's scalable parallel data processing engine, including distributed query processing, columnar execution, and streaming updates Develop novel and scalable systems combining hardware-accelerated data processing with machine learning and statistical hypothesis testing Technical leadership Shape the engineering culture through mentorship Build out our data plane Implement new analyses in our performance-critical data processing engine Optimize and scale data ingest and workload distribution Actively participate in customer POCs to optimize customer experience and adoption. Work collaboratively with multiple departments such as Sales, Marketing, and G&A.





Preferred Qualifications

 5+ years of relevant software engineering experience Fluency with a manual memory-managed language (C++, C, etc.) OR Rust Background in database internals or building core components for data processing systems (query compilation, query execution, storage engines, transaction processing) Strong CS fundamentals including data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems.

Voices across the country are not equitable. Public trust in elections is challenged like never before. The elections technology market is an oligopoly that has stifled innovation. The odds are stacked, but Clear Ballot rises to the challenge with a simple goal: Let’s create technology that empowers our customers to improve democracy. Elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, with voting being our greatest freedom. While most Americans across the country watch and read about elections, Clear Ballot lives them. A great election includes secure, reliable tabulation equipment, full transparency of the process, and the ability to audit the results. Our mission is to surpass those expectations in a way that will raise the bar for the entire election technology industry.

As the leader in election innovation, Clear Ballot has introduced a new class of tools and a modern approach to voting, enabling unprecedented speed, accuracy, and transparency that officials and the voting public have sought for decades. Clear Ballot entered the election industry with its first product in 2012, disrupting the industry with the nation’s first independent, automated audit, and four years later developed a complete voting system which is now the fastest growing voting system in the industry. Clear Ballot’s commitment to ease of use and modern technology means that its browser-based software runs on the most modern operating systems in the industry and will always be up to date.

At Clear Ballot, we view collaboration as one of our main drivers for success and we are open to all our employees to share their thoughts and ideas to help both to turn our bold vision into a reality and to make Clear Ballot a great place to work.

As we continue to expand and diversify our portfolio with the development of the ocV!BE project, it becomes increasingly important to have subject matter experts to help lead this exciting effort. Reporting directly to the Director of Software Engineering, the UI/Web Senior Software Product Engineer serves as a vital member of this team, playing a significant role and responsible for designing and implementing intelligent and efficient UIs. This role will assist in the build-out of the department, including the establishment of systems, setting up group-wide processes and governance, determining the culture, and implementing technologies to support the efficiency and effectiveness of ocV!BE DxD functions and other key activities essential to building a nimble, smart, collaborative, and highly effective team.
  


    Our Team: The DxD team accelerates experiential opportunities through design and technology campaigns

 Success means that modern, sophisticated audiences - with a plethora of choices and deep concerns about privacy - are attracted, converted, and retained
 This is accomplished via omnipresent, immersive, timely, relevant, and friction-reducing content
 Delivering these solutions requires cutting edge experience, data, and content management platforms that are built by people who understand the nature of experience design and focus just as much on the end audience experience as the Litehouse user experience
 Orchestrating technologies, teams, and workflows (which to date have been disparate and fragmented), should solve for the complexities of myriad technologies and workflows within a single platform
 Litehouse’s flexibility is finite; Litehouse can interconnect and orchestrate virtually any system or process and does so in a standardized way that is repeatable/scalable
 Litehouse solutions are built by analyzing the nature of the work of experts and embedding that expertise within components of the Litehouse platform
 Litehouse empowers users to focus on their vision, delivering confidence that their tools will supplement and expand upon their own capabilities

    A day in the life of a software engineer at PNNL might start by reviewing any open pull requests on the group’s Git repository or checking for any failed deployment builds on your current projects. As you’re finishing up your second cup of coffee, you attend a pair-programming session with a teammate to implement a new background-service within the API. After a productive half-hour, they have a clear path forward and can continue.
  


 You begin the next assigned work-ticket, which involves putting together a Makefile to simplify common build/test/deploy procedures for the API. Upon completion and updating the README, you open a pull request for your teammates to review your work. Next, you might study user requirements for the new project you’re on before honing your creativity skills and designing a couple of wireframes. Satisfied with your mock-ups, you send them out for review and reflect on another productive and exciting day applying your skills to make the nation more secure.

At Glowforge, we help people bring home the future and make it their own. Our printer uses a laser to carve and engrave products from raw materials like wood, leather, acrylic – even cardboard. Take a look and see for yourself.
 We build magical products to delight our customers, and we do it while taking care of each other. We hire people who are outstanding at what they do, who thrive in tight-knit teams, and who want to make things that make a difference.
 Together, we've built a product we're incredibly proud of, and the reward has been incredible growth. We work together because we believe in the power of creativity. We believe we can bring about a future where anyone can print anything.
 We'd love to have you join us.
 We're a remote-first company - just let us know where you prefer to work from!
 Why We Need You
 One of the unusual things about the Glowforge is that we moved many engineering problems from hardware to software. Our cloud service does the heavy lifting for features like alignment and autofocus. It also makes it dead easy to diagram, draw, or doodle your invention and print it directly to wood, acrylic, fabric, leather, or paper.
 Everything our customers do depends on our software being there for them. Without our services, we don't have a business. That's why our whole company will depend on you. We want your passion and thoughtfulness around systems engineering and operational excellence. We’ll ask you to tackle problems that enable our product to operate efficiently as it rapidly expands to meet growing demand, from multi-service deployments to incident response. We are looking for you to spread your SRE knowledge through an organization with a strong DevOps culture that is eager to learn.
 Here’s what you’ll be doing

First and foremost, any task that helps us manage and scale our growing infrastructure to ensure an outstanding experience for our customers — which will include stretching your technical skills and supporting your colleagues when they need help.
Lead, mentor, and help grow a team of SREs that work alongside our application developers to meet a common set of goals for our service. You’ll iterate on service objectives with the team, translate them to architecture and implementation plans, and then get to work shipping code and configuration that bring it to life!
Ensure our services are properly instrumented, resilient against outages, responsive to appropriate mediations, and monitored at various scopes to track uptime and stability.
Partner with the product and data teams to ensure our systems are appropriately provisioned to meet the growing needs of a rapidly expanding company.

You need these qualifications

You have at least ten years of combined professional experience in software development and systems engineering and a relevant 4-year degree or equivalent experience.
You’ve successfully managed the services of a web product that people love.
You’re comfortable in various programming languages, including one or more of Ruby, Python, NodeJS, and Rust.
You take joy in pragmatically handling the details of CI/CD deployment pipelines, monitoring distributed systems, third-party SaaS integrations, configuring complex ingress rules, and tracking feature flags, and can utilize all of these tools to maintain rapidly growing services at a global scale.

It would be nice if…

You are familiar with Google Cloud Platform.
You are deeply comfortable with Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform
You have experience with the NewRelic, Atlassian, and PagerDuty APIs

Send us a resume or a link to whatever showcases your skills the best. If a resume isn’t handy, a LinkedIn profile or GitHub account is fine. We can’t wait to meet you.
 There's one more, very important thing. We are an equal opportunity employer. We search for amazing people of diverse backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. We take care of each other to create an inclusive work environment where we love to come to work every day. We'd be happy to provide reasonable accommodations to help you apply - just email us at jobs@glowforge.com. We hope you can join us.

Our culture rewards autonomy and initiative and we foster a stable environment where personal and professional growth is prioritized.
For this position, we are looking for highly skilled software engineers to join our augmented reality team. ARA’s ARC4 augmented reality technology is used by the US Army and others to improve the situational awareness of our soldiers on the battlefield. ARC4 provides accurate, timely information so that teams can make the right decisions and operate with enhanced safety and speed. It is not an overstatement to say that this capability will save lives, by improving coordination, decisiveness, and communication.
Specifically, we need engineers and scientists who have the ability or interest to design and implement defense-grade augmented reality software. The software you develop will be fielded on a wide range of Army systems, including night-vision goggles, ground vehicles, and far target locators.
Our technology:
C++17 application software built for Windows, Linux, and Android (heavy use of Android NDK) using Qt, OpenGL, Eigen, libUSB, and ZMQ
Kotlin application software built for Windows and Android using JavaFX
Microcontroller software built-in Rust and C
Embedded web server software built with Node.js and React
CI build and package management system built with Jenkins, CMake, Gradle, and Conan
Our team’s interests:
Low-latency inter-device communication and high-performance inter-process data sharing. We write software that moves inertial sensor data and video data between embedded systems as fast as possible
Extensible software. We write applications for customers who want to build their own add-ons and plug-ins, so we think about APIs, data protocols, and how to hot-load 3rd-party code
Safe concurrency. Knowing patterns for working with concurrent code safely is critically important for our applications
Cross-platform code. Our customers use many different platforms, so we know the difference between compiling with GCC vs Clang vs MSVC and when to utilize the JVM or web technology
Our code runs on devices that people work with and wear in heterogeneous processing hardware under unique resource constraints. This also means we employ multiple strategies to test our code from automated unit testing to device emulation and field testing
Putting math to work. Our products are often born from research projects which means learning and applying advanced math is how we deliver to our customers
Entry-Level Augmented Reality Software Engineer Candidates must have:
The nature of work (i.e. interactions with the intelligence community and DoD programs) requires the eligibility to apply for and hold a US security clearance; selected applicants will undergo a security investigation and must meet eligibility requirements at the time of employment
One of the following:
A Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or related STEM field with 0-2 years of professional experience
A Master’s degree in Computer Science or related STEM field
A strong understanding of either C++17, Kotlin, or Rust
Some experience in at least one of our technologies or interests

 We build magical products to delight our customers, and we do it while taking care of each other. We hire people who are outstanding at what they do, who thrive in tight-knit teams, and who want to make things that make a difference.
 Together, we've built a product we're incredibly proud of, and the reward has been incredible growth. We work together because we believe in the power of creativity. We believe we can bring about a future where anyone can print anything.
 We'd love to have you join us.
 We're a remote-first company - just let us know where you prefer to work from!
 Why We Need You
 One of the unusual things about the Glowforge is that we moved many engineering problems from hardware to software. Our cloud service does the heavy lifting for features like alignment and autofocus. It also makes it dead easy to diagram, draw, or doodle your invention and print it directly to wood, acrylic, fabric, leather, or paper.
 Everything our customers do depends on our software being there for them. Without our services, we don't have a business. That's why our whole company will depend on you. We want your passion and thoughtfulness around systems engineering and operational excellence. We’ll ask you to tackle problems that enable our product to operate efficiently as it rapidly expands to meet growing demand, from multi-service deployments to incident response.

 Here’s what you’ll be doing

First and foremost, any task that helps us manage and scale our growing infrastructure to ensure an outstanding experience for our customers — which will include stretching your technical skills and supporting your colleagues when they need help.
Lead, mentor, and help grow a team of SREs that work alongside our application developers to meet a common set of goals for our service. You’ll iterate on service objectives with the team, translate them to architecture and implementation plans, and then get to work shipping code and configuration that bring it to life!
Ensure our services are properly instrumented, resilient against outages, responsive to appropriate mediations, and monitored at various scopes to track uptime and stability.
Partner with the product and data teams to ensure our systems are appropriately provisioned to meet the growing needs of a rapidly expanding company.

You need these qualifications

You have at least ten years of combined professional experience in software development and systems engineering and a relevant 4-year degree or equivalent experience.
You’ve successfully managed the services of a web product that people love.
You’re comfortable in various programming languages, including one or more of Ruby, Python, NodeJS, and Rust.
You take joy in pragmatically handling the details of CI/CD deployment pipelines, monitoring distributed systems, third-party SaaS integrations, configuring complex ingress rules, and tracking feature flags, and can utilize all of these tools to maintain rapidly growing services at a global scale.

It would be nice if…

You are familiar with Google Cloud Platform.
You are deeply comfortable with Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform
You have experience with the NewRelic, Atlassian, and PagerDuty APIs

Send us a resume or a link to whatever showcases your skills the best. If a resume isn’t handy, a LinkedIn profile or GitHub account is fine. We can’t wait to meet you.
 There's one more, very important thing. We are an equal opportunity employer. We search for amazing people of diverse backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. We take care of each other to create an inclusive work environment where we love to come to work every day.

Job Details 
PLEASE NOTE: Qualification for this job is contingent upon acceptable results from a background investigation as well as your obtaining and maintaining the specific level U.S. government background investigation required for this role. 

Role: Software Engineer (Backend) 
Level: Senior /Lead/ Principal 
Location: Washington DC / Northern Virginia 

Join the team of Software engineers using the latest cloud automation technologies, including Helm, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and a wide range of programming languages, including Golang, Java, Rust, Python, and Javascript, and cutting-edge machine learning tools such as TensorFlow and natural language processing tools for named entity recognition and entity disambiguation and resolution. You will be involved with all aspects of product creation and deployment –– from understanding cryptography requirements for NIST 800 accreditations all the way up to ensuring that user clicks drive learning feedback loops in the most optimal manner for the mission. 

Salesforce’s text mining products are inspired by human collaboration. Users invite the AI agent to collaborate with them. You invite the agent’s application sensors into your working documents and tools, so it can see what you are working on ––– like a person sitting next to you at your desk. With this view of you and your team's digital work, it infers your goals and current state of knowledge. Then it finds, ranks, and presents information about related entities, adapting in real-time as you interact with these recommendations. The key technology insight is that coupling machine learning algorithms to people’s interactions with software tools captures feedback signals that allow human language technologies to dramatically outperform previous approaches. Instead of optimizing average case behavior across bulk data, our approach focuses machine resources on data that is closest to the user’s current activity. This collaborative learning approach allows the text retrieval stack to generate recommendations with human-level quality at machine scale. This enables customer analysts to find more complete or harder to find information about their subjects of interest, and do it faster than traditional text retrieval systems. 

Description: 
This position is for a Backend - Software engineer that will work on both sides of the airgap by contributing to core product source code and features as well as seeing those features through to real mission impact in the customer’s environment. The focus is on technical problem solving throughout the entire software stack and system operations. This includes developing solutions that (1) enable ATO processes, and (2) ensure system interface connections to sensitive data sources, and (3) enhance end-user effectiveness, and (4) identify new opportunities for AI to accelerate mission outcomes. As a member of our core product team, you will be embedded with our customers and technical field team members. You will be a go-to expert for the customer on all aspects of the system. 

Requirements: 

Experience writing product code across a range of languages. 
A willingness to learn new programming languages, including Java, Golang, and Python, so that you can dive into any part of the product and figure out what’s going on. Specifically, to develop this kind of product, we need you to troubleshoot on-site where the majority of the engineering team cannot. 
Experience developing new cloud-based products and causing them to reach production deployment. 
Excellent problem solving skills and an instinctive desire to collaborate with technical experts across both the customer and the company. 
Thoughtful approach to digesting technical challenges into solvable elements. 
Can-do attitude that naturally prioritizes tasks by risks-and-rewards to mission impact. 
An understanding of NIST 800-53 and government RMF system authorization processes and experience providing technical solutions that enable the larger team to drive through to ATO. 
A deep understanding of computer systems and experience creating and revising them in a federal government environment. 
Experience solving mission-relevant challenges using data and algorithms is a plus. 
Current cybersecurity credentials of Security+ or higher 
Strong verbal, written, and interpersonal skills 

Responsibilities : 

Understanding the mission use cases, how the system can best accelerate analysts on them, as well as the system’s limitations. 
Understand the full-stack from end-to-end, so you can dive in anywhere. 
Identify key data sources required to succeed in the mission, and how to integrate the system with them. 
Understand the customer’s cybersecurity requirements, and how the system can meet them. 
Evaluate new technologies to solve problems as needed, and also play a significant role in architectural direction 
Support others who are documenting cybersecurity requirements and working through ATO processes. 
Be the face of Salesforce, Einstein Relationship Insights, and collaborative AI to the customer, to include briefings, demos, and advice. 
Be the advocate of the customer to the rest of Salesforce. 


Tools and Technologies 

We are a highly adaptive and innovative environment. Familiarity with the following specific technologies is far less important than an interest and ability to learn and evaluate new technologies. 
We use Linux, Windows, and AWS technologies including services, encryption, logging, networking, and security features 
We use configuration management and deployment tools including kubernetes, ansible, git, and docker 
We use programming languages including python, golang, javascript, bash, and powershell

In this role, you will: 

Work with a wide range of software. We build and run on everything from legacy Unix systems to the cloud to mobile devices. We don’t do any desktop development, but touch most everything else, including significant web applications, streaming data processing, large-scale analytics and mobile apps for iOS and Android. 
Work with Ops to get stuff out the door. We do releases multiple times per week, so you’ll work closely with our operations team to make sure that releases go out smoothly and continue to operate that way post-release. We own what we ship. 
Collaborate with our Product team. You’ll interact on a daily basis with our product leads to explore new functionality, flesh out new ideas and help plan out future directions for our service. 
Make our customers’ lives easier. Our entire monitoring platform is built by our development team with the goal of improving the lives of our customers. In addition to building new functionality there is ample opportunity to fix bugs, refactor code, and make yourself a better developer. 
Craft and lead the development process. We’re always looking to improve how we build and release software, and expect everyone to help drive that forward. 
Shape the future of our tech. Want to explore a new technology? Look into it. Then tell us why we should (or shouldn't) use it. 


Tools You’ll Use: 

Python and Go - The bulk of our infrastructure is built in Python, with a growing use of Go in performance-sensitive areas. This includes web applications built on Flask, TurboGears and Tornado as well as lots of custom distributed applications that run our data collection and processing system. 
Kafka - We use Kafka for our core backend data processing in a streaming model for ingestion and processing of metric data. 
MySQL and InfluxDB - These two systems support our core customer/configuration and time series data. 
Vue.js - Our web application makes use of Vue to make interfaces as composable and usable as possible. 
Google Cloud Platform - our SaaS service runs in Google’s cloud environment, making use of their managed services wherever possible. We also work closely with AWS and Azure for customer environments. 
Ansible & Terraform - All packaging and deployment of our software is automated to support regular, streamlined releases. 


Minimum Qualifications: 

Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or related field. Master’s degree preferred. 
5+ years of Python experience. Experience with Go, Rust or similar languages is a bonus. 
Solid Linux experience. You have hands on, real-world experience with it. We mainly use Ubuntu for our internal systems, but also support RHEL, Solaris/AIX, BSD, CentOS, Windows and whatever else customers may need. 
Professional experience with Vue.js, React, Ember, or similar. 
Proficient with relational databases - either MySQL, Postgresql or Oracle. 
Experience developing large-scale applications. We build and operate global-scale distributed systems, with monitoring nodes around the world (50+ locations) and utilize parallel and concurrent principles heavily. 


Bonus Points for: 

Familiarity with systems and network administration. You don’t need to be a sysadmin to be successful in this role, but most of our customers are; an understanding of how they work and think is valuable to delivering the best solutions for them. 
Experience with machine learning and advanced statistical applications, especially for time series analysis and event correlation. 
Performance and scalability engineering experience 
Vendor API integration experience, especially for enterprise-class networking, storage and compute infrastructure

    Job Title:
   Senior Product Engineer - Backend Developer
  

    ocV!BE, the premier mixed-use community and live entertainment district, is coming to Anaheim in 2024! ocV!BE will provide a live, work, and play community of a scale not seen in Orange County before, with live entertainment events and activities year-round.
  


    ocV!BE is an endeavor of the Samueli Family, the owner of the Anaheim Ducks and the longtime manager of Honda Center. This $3 billion, 95-acre, mixed-use community will surround its anchor, Honda Center, with new live entertainment venues, dining and retail offerings, and public amenities. From intimate clubs to a new 6K-capacity concert venue, ocV!BE will provide a full range of entertainment, activating the District daily for the enjoyment of its guests. Once built, our overall goal for District attendance will exceed 8M patrons per year!
  


    The proposed 95-acre, mixed-use ocV!BE development will feature:
   

A sustainable community emphasizing walkability, health and wellness, and lifestyle amenities
A new 5,700-capacity concert venue
Uniquely themed and intimate clubs
1.1+ million square feet of office space, including a new 325,000-square foot office tower
1,500 residential units, including a commitment of 15% affordable housing units
20 acres of public open space, including 4 unique plazas
10 acres of publicly accessible parks, including a more than 4-acre park focused on wellness and nature and a 5-acre riverfront park with the ability to host seasonal outdoor concerts and events
30+ restaurant concepts, including a food hall with diverse offerings and multiple standalone restaurants
Two hotels, consisting of 550 rooms total, thematically aligned with the energy of the District
8,000+ parking spaces among several structures, new roads, and increased capacity to enhance ingress/egress
10,000 new construction jobs and 3,000 permanent jobs upon completion




    ocV!BE Digital Experience Design (DxD) is an embedded creative technology team that helps radically transform places into futuristic experiences with integrity and resonance. As we continue to expand and diversify our portfolio with the development of the ocV!BE project, it becomes increasingly important to have subject matter experts to help lead this exciting effort. Reporting directly to the Vice President of Product, the Backend Developer serves as a vital member of this team, playing a significant role and responsible for helping to guide product visions to reality. This role will assist in the build-out of the department, including the establishment of systems, setting up group-wide processes and governance, determining the culture, and implementing technologies to support the efficiency and effectiveness of ocV!BE DxD functions and other key activities essential to building a nimble, smart, collaborative, and highly effective team.
  


    Our Team: The DxD team accelerates experiential opportunities through design and technology campaigns
   

Our work connects physical and digital worlds, extending from immersive brand experiences to connected customer applications and smart building design
We deliver impactful customer experiences through immersive and interactive activations, district applications, high impact fan activations, emerging technology campaigns, and more
We are a passionate and multidisciplinary team made up of creatives, strategists, environment designers, software engineers, system architects, and creative technologists who are building the future of experience management
We believe in responsibly designing for the future across digital, physical, and virtual realms




    The Product: Litehouse is ocV!BE’s proprietary platform that makes technology-driven experience design accessible to all, enabling users to build emotional and resonant connections with people across digital, virtual, and physical realms. Operating with six primary principles, our team behind Litehouse believes:
   

Success means that modern, sophisticated audiences - with a plethora of choices and deep concerns about privacy - are attracted, converted, and retained
This is accomplished via omnipresent, immersive, timely, relevant, and friction-reducing content
Delivering these solutions requires cutting edge experience, data, and content management platforms that are built by people who understand the nature of experience design and focus just as much on the end audience experience as the Litehouse user experience
Orchestrating technologies, teams, and workflows (which to date have been disparate and fragmented), should solve for the complexities of myriad technologies and workflows within a single platform
Litehouse’s flexibility is finite; Litehouse can interconnect and orchestrate virtually any system or process and does so in a standardized way that is repeatable/scalable
Litehouse solutions are built by analyzing the nature of the work of experts and embedding that expertise within components of the Litehouse platform
Litehouse empowers users to focus on their vision, delivering confidence that their tools will supplement and expand upon their own capabilities




    The Work: As a Backend Developer, you will also work with a multidisciplinary team such as System Engineers, UI Engineers, and Creative Technologists—to help guide product visions to reality by:
  

 Working to evolve, develop, launch, and expand Britelite’s core SaaS platform, Litehouse
 Participating in scoping, prototyping, testing, developing, deploying, maintaining, and evolving items on the Litehouse product roadmap
 Deeply understanding our product in support of its development, growth, and enablement of client success
 Contributing to exceptional software, hardware, and design solutions that exceed expectations
 Understanding the bigger picture and the purpose of software to ensure and improve its quality and fitness-for-purpose
 Writing clean, end-to-end code in support of the above
 Evaluating, promoting, and maintaining software and solution quality



    Skills: This role requires:
  

 5 years of product-focused software architecture/engineering experience
 Major experience with Node.js and Python
 Use of clean software architectures, like Hexagonal or Port-Adapter Architecture, and SOLID principles, like Dependency/Control Inversion
 Experience with WebAssembly and low-level systems programming languages, such as C/C++, Go, Rust
 Excellent product instincts
 A firm grasp of modern web protocols (e.g., QUIC) and experience designing and interfacing with a wide variety of APIs
 Familiarity with cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, etc.) and deployment/configuration
 Someone who always thinks about users first, then delivers the best technical solution, if there is one, to enable a premium experience for them
 Someone known for shipping solid, scalable SaaS platform products and features rapidly via an iterative process
 An excellent independent problem solver and proactive communicator who can self-direct
 Architectural thinking: Ability to design (or assist with design) and carry out implementation of software-intensive systems from an infrastructure, application, technical, and operational perspective
 Someone who thrives in novel, first-of-a-kind settings, with creative contribution informed by technical acumen
 Focus on performance: Acknowledges the importance of performant software heading into the future and is well-versed in performance engineering practices and tools
 Someone who considers the operational impact of software and has experience developing automation/autonomous solutions (self-healing, self-forming based on AIOps, for example)
 Ability to learn and master new technologies very quickly



    Culture & Fit: This role is an excellent fit for anyone who:
  

 Is an independent, careful thinker who is passionate about the work and places a premium on craftsmanship, professional responsibility, data privacy, and ethical design
 Is excited to work on bleeding-edge technologies and devote mindshare to solving the problems of tomorrow today

 Has a healthy appreciation for and use of Slack’s Giphy integration
 Lives in or might be interested in relocating to sunny Southern California

Come join us and help advance state-of-the-art network intelligence and analytics.

What We Do at Deepfield

A day in the life of a software engineer at PNNL might start by reviewing any open pull requests on the group’s Git repository or checking for any failed deployment builds on your current projects. As you’re finishing up your second cup of coffee, you attend a pair-programming session with a teammate to implement a new background-service within the API. After a productive half-hour, they have a clear path forward and can continue.
You begin the next assigned work-ticket, which involves putting together a Makefile to simplify common build/test/deploy procedures for the API. Upon completion and updating the README, you open a pull request for your teammates to review your work. Next, you might study user requirements for the new project you’re on before honing your creativity skills and designing a couple of wireframes. Satisfied with your mock-ups, you send them out for review and reflect on another productive and exciting day applying your skills to make the nation more secure.

Job Details 
PLEASE NOTE: Qualification for this job is contingent upon acceptable results from a background investigation as well as your obtaining and maintaining the specific level U.S. government background investigation required for this role. 

Role: Software Engineer (Backend) 
Level: Senior /Lead/ Principal 
Location: Washington DC / Northern Virginia 

Join the team of Software engineers using the latest cloud automation technologies, including Helm, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and a wide range of programming languages, including Golang, Java, Rust, Python, and Javascript, and cutting-edge machine learning tools such as TensorFlow and natural language processing tools for named entity recognition and entity disambiguation and resolution. You will be involved with all aspects of product creation and deployment –– from understanding cryptography requirements for NIST 800 accreditations all the way up to ensuring that user clicks drive learning feedback loops in the most optimal manner for the mission. 

Salesforce’s text mining products are inspired by human collaboration. Users invite the AI agent to collaborate with them. You invite the agent’s application sensors into your working documents and tools, so it can see what you are working on ––– like a person sitting next to you at your desk. With this view of you and your team's digital work, it infers your goals and current state of knowledge. Then it finds, ranks, and presents information about related entities, adapting in real-time as you interact with these recommendations. The key technology insight is that coupling machine learning algorithms to people’s interactions with software tools captures feedback signals that allow human language technologies to dramatically outperform previous approaches. Instead of optimizing average case behavior across bulk data, our approach focuses machine resources on data that is closest to the user’s current activity. This collaborative learning approach allows the text retrieval stack to generate recommendations with human-level quality at machine scale. This enables customer analysts to find more complete or harder to find information about their subjects of interest, and do it faster than traditional text retrieval systems. 

Description: 
This position is for a Backend - Software engineer that will work on both sides of the airgap by contributing to core product source code and features as well as seeing those features through to real mission impact in the customer’s environment. The focus is on technical problem solving throughout the entire software stack and system operations. This includes developing solutions that (1) enable ATO processes, and (2) ensure system interface connections to sensitive data sources, and (3) enhance end-user effectiveness, and (4) identify new opportunities for AI to accelerate mission outcomes. As a member of our core product team, you will be embedded with our customers and technical field team members. You will be a go-to expert for the customer on all aspects of the system. 

Requirements: 

Experience writing product code across a range of languages. 
A willingness to learn new programming languages, including Java, Golang, and Python, so that you can dive into any part of the product and figure out what’s going on. Specifically, to develop this kind of product, we need you to troubleshoot on-site where the majority of the engineering team cannot. 
Experience developing new cloud-based products and causing them to reach production deployment. 
Excellent problem solving skills and an instinctive desire to collaborate with technical experts across both the customer and the company. 
Thoughtful approach to digesting technical challenges into solvable elements. 
Can-do attitude that naturally prioritizes tasks by risks-and-rewards to mission impact. 
An understanding of NIST 800-53 and government RMF system authorization processes and experience providing technical solutions that enable the larger team to drive through to ATO. 
A deep understanding of computer systems and experience creating and revising them in a federal government environment. 
Experience solving mission-relevant challenges using data and algorithms is a plus. 
Current cybersecurity credentials of Security+ or higher 
Strong verbal, written, and interpersonal skills 

Responsibilities : 

Understanding the mission use cases, how the system can best accelerate analysts on them, as well as the system’s limitations. 
Understand the full-stack from end-to-end, so you can dive in anywhere. 
Identify key data sources required to succeed in the mission, and how to integrate the system with them. 
Understand the customer’s cybersecurity requirements, and how the system can meet them. 
Evaluate new technologies to solve problems as needed, and also play a significant role in architectural direction 
Support others who are documenting cybersecurity requirements and working through ATO processes. 
Be the face of Salesforce, Einstein Relationship Insights, and collaborative AI to the customer, to include briefings, demos, and advice. 
Be the advocate of the customer to the rest of Salesforce. 


Tools and Technologies 

We are a highly adaptive and innovative environment. Familiarity with the following specific technologies is far less important than an interest and ability to learn and evaluate new technologies. 
We use Linux, Windows, and AWS technologies including services, encryption, logging, networking, and security features 
We use configuration management and deployment tools including kubernetes, ansible, git, and docker 
We use programming languages including python, golang, javascript, bash, and powershell

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers-at no cost.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

newJunior Software Engineer;https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=61dc260c0ece83c9;Remote;yes;"
Interested Applicants Must Apply on Company Website: https://www.twobarrels.com/jobs/software/developer/
Overview: 
Two Barrels is hiring a Junior Software Engineer for $75,000/year. You will be a traditional company employee. This is a full time 40 hour/week position with company benefits in Spokane, Washington.
Two Barrels is always hiring great Software Engineers. We primarily code in Ruby, Javascript and use Rails and Vue. We classify this position as an entry level position within our Software Department.
Our Junior Software Developer job is a path towards becoming an integral part of our software team. This position is geared towards developers with limited experience or a recent college graduate. Through working with our team of developers, this position will put you on the path towards gaining more skills and experience to help you advance within our company.
Junior Software Engineer Jobs: 
Our Junior Software Engineers spend their first year integrating and hopefully advance to becoming Software Engineers within our company. We offer a guaranteed 6 month assessment with an opportunity for a wage increase based on your proficiency in some key skills. We’ll work with you and bring you along to become a vital part of our group. This is our entry level software developer position and a great way to get started with our company. We’re looking for great people who want to do great work. We understand you might suck at writing resumes or pitching yourself, or most your code might be private. Try your best to explain to us what you can do so we can hopefully find you! If you’re a good person, like learning and improving, and want to grow your skills, we want to find you.
How to Apply: 
Please apply through the link below. It’s a coding job, so showing us some code would be helpful. Preferably a flavor of Ruby or Javascript, but anything for now will do.
What’s in a title?
Here at Two Barrels we don’t take titles very seriously. We know for recruiting purposes we need to call our jobs something, so we started with labeling and differentiating them in a fairly traditional way with “junior, mid, senior”. However, we’ve realized that was putting our employees in a box and wasn’t allowing us to uniquely identify their individual contributions, strengths and professional goals. Once you join our team the titles kinda get dropped as we expect everyone to work with everyone regardless of title or experience. We have taken the approach of evaluating candidates and employees on a “level” basis. It makes it a little easier internally to talk about growing into the next level without there being this huge chasm between what it means to be a Junior Engineer vs. a Mid Engineer. Our levels have expectations set for each one and it’s the responsibility of the manager and employee to make sure there is alignment. We do this through quarterly conversations where we discuss employee progression, if the work is challenging, and to ensure they feel fairly compensated for their work and expertise. Basically, levels gives us more flexibility to help people grow in their careers. But sure, you can post your title on LinkedIn as what makes sense to the rest of the world.Location: Spokane, WA

Low level engineer (C++ / Rust / Go);https://justjoin.it/offers/seekr-low-level-engineer-c-rust-go;Berlin;no;"DescriptionOnline interviewFriendly offerLow level engineer (C++ / Rust / Go) Truly challenging work is actually quite difficult to find. Consider this advert a big green flag. Lots of job adverts talk about “building distributed systems at scale” but do they really have the numbers to back it up? Where a company has been around long enough to have seriously impressive user numbers has the interesting work all been done? Are they too big to innovate? Are they a social media company that wants to farm their users’ data? Are they a start-up that thinks they will have a million users but have no idea how they will actually get there? This business is none of those things they already have 12 million users and their product actually helps people protect their privacy on the internet from the prying eyes of all kinds of digital bad actors (including those working for FAANG.inc). The team at SEEKR is helping them in their mission by finding them awesome software engineers to join a new squad in Berlin (remote roles are also available). Here is what is on offer; Technically challenging work – work on software with millions of users across the globe running on in excess of 5000 servers. If your code breaks thousands of people lose their access to the internet. Resilience is baked into everything you do. Culture of innovation – You will have the chance to spend a fair amount of time in this role wearing an R&D hat and looking at writing software to test new ideas. One of the team leads we spoke to has already registered 3 patents in his time there! Friendly colleagues – This is a global business that feels like a friendly start-up. The teams are small, they care about culture and the lack of big egos means there is plenty of space to create your own niche. What do they need from you? If you don’t code in C/C++ right now you probably did in the past You are fascinated by the internals of various all various operating systems. Your code will form the bedrock for applications teams building for Linux, Windows, Andriod, and iOS. You will likely already have a deep understanding of one of the above and you have written cross-platform code in the past. Go or Rust is on your radar and you are itching to try these languages out in an environment that would truly test their capabilities How do you get involved? Apply to this advert. Simple. Send your CV if it is ready, send an old one if it isn’t. Download your LinkedIn profile as a PDF if you can’t find an old CV and send us that. Have none of those things? Write “CV” at the top of a blank Word document and add three lines as to why you would be a good fit for a low-level programming role.

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.
We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!
About the Team
Cloudflare helps build the future of the Internet. We started Cloudflare to solve one half of every IT organization's challenge: how do you ensure the resources and infrastructure that you expose to the Internet are safe from attack, fast, and reliable. We saw that the world was moving away from hardware and software to solve these problems and instead wanted a scalable service that would work around the world.
To deliver that, we built one of the world's largest networks. Today our network spans more than 250 cities worldwide and is within milliseconds of nearly everyone connected to the Internet. We have built the capacity to stand up to nation-state scale cyberattacks and a threat intelligence system powered by the immense amount of Internet traffic that we see.
We are now expanding Cloudflare’s product offerings to solve the other half of every IT organization's challenge: ensuring the people and teams within an organization can access the tools they need to do their jobs and are safe from malware and other online threats.
To do that, we released Cloudflare for Teams, a Zero Trust platform built on Cloudflare’s network to secure users, devices, and data in organizations of any size. Cloudflare for Teams consists of multiple products that deliver a comprehensive solution. Those products include
-Cloudflare Access, built to replace VPNs and protect internally-managed applications.
-Cloudflare Tunnel, the best way to connect your infrastructure to Cloudflare in a secure way.
-Cloudflare Gateway, a tool that keeps team members protected from malware and other threats on the Internet.
-The Cloudflare Zero Trust Agent, the secure on-ramp for your traffic to the Internet.
-Cloudflare Browser Isolation, the Internet’s fastest browser isolation technology
The newest product in the group, Cloudflare Data Loss Prevention (DLP), will help customers secure the data that powers their business without slowing down their team members. We’re excited to launch a next generation data control platform on Cloudflare’s network and we’re building a team to create that future.
What you’ll do
In this role you will contribute to the Cloudflare for Teams product family by building our new Data Loss Prevention (DLP) offering. This ambitious new product will be the Internet’s most comprehensive and performant DLP solution built on a global network that accelerates connections.
You will focus on our high-performance global edge network services and will also contribute to the control plane API’s that configure the edge services. You will be joining a team of bright, hard-working, and supportive engineers who really care about their craft.
Example of systems that the team currently is building:

A forward-proxy service running on every machine of Cloudflare’s extensive edge network, responsible for inspecting, filtering, and blocking device requests based on an organization’s configured policy.
A software defined routing system to interconnect our users devices and endpoints.
Remote Browsing sandbox capabilities
A policy engine that can run Zero Trust architecture on any network connection from customer devices and servers
Microservices that allow organizations to configure, manage, and observe their organization's devices and their respective traffic.

Technologies we use:

Core edge services are written in Rust and Go and deployed globally to 250+ data centers.
Our REST API is written in Go, runs on Kubernetes, and uses Postgres as a data store.
Our frontend is written in Typescript and React
For service monitoring we use Prometheus and Grafana
For service logging we use Elasticsearch and Kibana
For product analytics we use Clickhouse and BigQuery

Because you’ll be solving problems of massive scale and significance, and shaping the future of the Internet, you are a growth-oriented individual who enjoys being outside of your comfort zone in a fast-paced environment.
Examples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience
As an ideal candidate for this position, you are curious, hard-working, and passionate.
A rough list of the skills we would love to see you bring:

Solid understanding of networking protocols - including experience with HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
Basic understanding of software security, compression and encryption
Experience in designing and implementing secure and highly-available distributed systems
Willingness, curiosity, and enthusiasm to learn new programming languages, technologies, and systems
Strong interpersonal and communication skills. Caring and empathy are coveted traits here!

What Makes Cloudflare Special?
We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.
Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.
Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.
Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.
1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Rust/Core Runtime Developer - Staking (FRAME);https://startup.jobs/rust-core-runtime-developer-staking-frame-parity-3273800;Remote;yes;"Polkadot offers commoditized security in the form of validating state transitions for independent, parallel chains. Thus, staking, the economic system determining the set of authorities who can validate, is of the utmost importance. Polkadot uses Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS). The NPoS system of Polkadot is powered by Substrate’s FRAME framework, as a collection of modules (aka. Pallets), and multiple offchain instruments, tools and monitoring systems. In the future, Parity aims to migrate the majority of the NPoS system to its dedicated common-good parachain. 
The Staking team (itself being a subset of the FRAME team) is looking for more engineers to achieve this grand goal. We need to develop, maintain, and deploy our next generation staking solutions, oversee their deployment, and continuously monitor them for correctness. 
This goal enables Polkadot to scale to a network of stakeholder orders of magnitude larger, whilst maintaining an unparalleled degree of economic security and inclusion, which in turn will allow it to scale its parachain onboarding capacity. 
What you will do
You will join the FRAME team as a core developer, where you will work closely with other engineers to maintain and develop the entire FRAME framework, with an emphasis on aspects that are related to the NPoS system. Moreover, you will work closely with the common-good parachains team, focusing on technologies such as Cross-chain Messaging (XCM).
Responsibilities

Write clean, scalable, and “absolutely correct” runtime code aligned with all the standards of FRAME development. 
Maintain, refactor, and optimize existing runtime modules for scaling and long term use. 
Use XCM, parachains, Polkadot and its test-networks, paving the way for development of more common good parachains. 
Write extensive test-frameworks that help us battle-test every single aspect of the NPoS system to the utmost extent.
Maintain a high degree of transparency and communication with the Polkadot community. 
Communicate and collaborate with researchers, implementing their ideas and providing feedback back to them about their feasibility.
Extend the general FRAME API as a framework for blockchain runtime development, optimizing it for ease of use and correctness. 

Requirement

Experience working with Rust or other similar system level languages.
Knowledge of Blockchain protocols and applications. 
Experience managing the full lifecycle of software projects: development, deployment, maintenance and monitoring. 
Excellent communication and teamwork skills.

Nice-to-haves

Proven experience as a Smart Contract (Solidity) or Substrate Runtime (FRAME) developer.
Knowledge of the other flavors of Proof of Stake and their implementations. 
Experience with writing code in highly-available, highly-sensitive systems. 
Experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, and React for tool development.
Open source software background.

Benefits

Working on NPoS means working on one of the most impactful aspects of Polkadot: Your code directly enables the chain to secure itself, choose validators and nominators, reward them etc.  
Parity has ambitious goals, and values engineering excellence above all. Thus, if you are a curious engineer who looks forward to solving new problems everyday, you are looking at the right page. 
Working at Parity allows you a high degree of freedom and autonomy about how you go about achieving your goals. 
Parity has always been a remote-first company, and while you can benefit from it if you prefer, we organize frequent retreats for collaboration in various locations, including Lisbon and Berlin. 

Not a perfect match to our requirements? We're happy to receive your application anyways and hear how you think you can help us achieve our mission.

Rust Core Developer - Staking/PoS Engineer;https://startup.jobs/rust-core-developer-staking-pos-engineer-parity-3142808;Remote;yes;"Rust Core Developer - Staking/PoS Engineer 
Context 
Polkadot offers commoditized security in the form of validating state transitions for independent, parallel chains. Thus, staking, the economic system determining the set of authorities who can validate, is of the utmost importance. Polkadot uses Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS). The NPoS system of Polkadot is powered by Substrate’s FRAME framework, as a collection of modules (aka. Pallets), and multiple offchain instruments, tools and monitoring systems. In the future, Parity aims to migrate the majority of the NPoS system to its dedicated common-good parachain. 
 
The Staking team (itself being a subset of the FRAME team) is looking for more engineers to achieve this grand goal. We need to develop, maintain, and deploy our next generation staking solutions, oversee their deployment, and continuously monitor them for correctness. 
 
This goal enables Polkadot to scale to a network of stakeholder orders of magnitude larger, whilst maintaining an unparalleled degree of economic security and inclusion, which in turn will allow it to scale its parachain onboarding capacity. 
What you will do
You will join the FRAME team as a core developer, where you will work closely with other engineers to maintain and develop the entire FRAME framework, with an emphasis on aspects that are related to the NPoS system. Moreover, you will work closely with the common-good parachains team, focusing on technologies such as Cross-chain Messaging (XCM).
Responsibilities

Write clean, scalable, and “absolutely correct” runtime code aligned with all the standards of FRAME development. 
Maintain, refactor, and optimize existing runtime modules for scaling and long term use. 
Use XCM, parachains, Polkadot and its test-networks, paving the way for development of more common good parachains. 
Write extensive test-frameworks that help us battle-test every single aspect of the NPoS system to the utmost extent.
Maintain a high degree of transparency and communication with the Polkadot community. 
Communicate and collaborate with researchers, implementing their ideas and providing feedback back to them about their feasibility.
Extend the general FRAME API as a framework for blockchain runtime development, optimizing it for ease of use and correctness. 

Requirement

Experience working with Rust or other similar system level languages.
Knowledge of Blockchain protocols and applications. 
Experience managing the full lifecycle of software projects: development, deployment, maintenance and monitoring. 
Excellent communication and teamwork skills.

Nice-to-haves

Proven experience as a Smart Contract (Solidity) or Substrate Runtime (FRAME) developer.
Knowledge of the other flavorus of Proof of Stake and their implementations. 
Experience with writing code in highly-available, highly-sensitive systems. 
Experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, and React for tool development.
Open source software background.

Benefits

Working on NPoS means working on one of the most impactful aspects of Polkadot: Your code directly enables the chain to secure itself, choose validators and nominators, reward them etc.  
Parity has ambitious goals, and values engineering excellence above all. Thus, if you are a curious engineer who looks forward to solving new problems everyday, you are looking at the right page. 
Working at Parity allows you a high degree of freedom and autonomy about how you go about achieving your goals. 
Parity has always been a remote-first company, and while you can benefit from it if you prefer, we organize frequent retreats for collaboration in various locations, including Lisbon and Berlin.  

 
This role is very similar to both “Runtime Developer” and “Common Good Parachains”. Both of these positions are slightly more general, and in fact you will have the freedom to find your way in either of these two teams in the long term future.";;;

We find the best wherever they live, to build better software by applying mathematics, computer science and the methods of open source.
Our core engineering mantras: functional, typed, immutable. These are the key technologies for composable software. We build parts as functions, because functions compose where objects do not. We use types to describe functions, because one type is worth a thousand out-of-date comments. We keep data immutable, because immutability lets us focus on the business logic holistically without getting bogged down by hundreds of corner cases.
Tweag is a major proponent and contributor to new ways of building composable software.

As a senior Rust software engineer at RDX Works, you will join a team of distributed systems engineers working to bring our smart contract functionality, Scrypto, to the Radix public network. Scrypto is a RDX-created framework and extension to the Rust programming language to enable the rapid and safe development of decentralized financial applications (dApps) that will power the future of DeFi into the mainstream. At RDX, we love Rust. Our smart-contract capability, Scrypto, is Rust-based, the new v2 Radix Engine is built from the ground-up in Rust, and we’re looking to extend its use to the code that runs the Radix Network. This is where we need your help.When you join us, you will first come up to speed by aiding in the migration of part of the existing codebase from Java to Rust. Building upon this knowledge, you will venture into new territory, solving the challenges ahead to bring programmability to the Radix public network. From this point forward you will be making new ground right at the cutting edge of a rapidly evolving branch of computer science, as we embark on a journey towards a novel, massively sharded release which will enable unlimited scale.Your days will be filled with hard, interesting problems - thinking through all the ways things can go wrong and coming up with solutions which are both elegant and practical - and then turning these into code. You will be tackling synchronization, consensus and networking problems that often have no perfect answer. You will meddle with dark powers best left untouched, learn more about decentralized systems than you dreamed was possible, and work with an inspiring team of incredible people. You will make your mother proud, even if you’re never quite able to properly explain to her what it is you built.What are we looking for?  You are a prolific, confident coder, and are persistent in working problems to resolution You possess strong attention to detail, and are rarely surprised by unconsidered edge cases You’ve used generic types so much that the angle bracket keys on your keyboard are beginning to wear away You are unafraid of working in a space where there is little prior art to refer to You have done and like to do demonstrably hard things You enjoy talking through tough problems with smart people, and are happy to accept ideas and approaches that you didn’t personally come up with You are someone who started to learn Rust for fun and now have several years of experience under your belt You are able to explain hard concepts in a clear and concise manner  What do you need? Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or similar Solid commercial experience working as a Software Developer Fluent in Rust and comfortable reading Java Completely comfortable with asynchronous programming models Some of the following experience will help you stand out: Noddingly familiar with the practical aspects of asymmetric cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs, and having an understanding of the underlying theoretical foundations First-hand experience working with large data sets and dealing with complex distributed systems, and are all too familiar with the attendant complications and gremlins that emerge once not-perfectly-reliable things start talking to each other over a not-perfectly-reliable network Experience with or knowledge of authenticated data structures Hands-on experience with big data tools such as Hadoop, Cassandra etc Experience with blockchain/DLT development Have a background in computer science or a scientific qualification with demonstrable experience in consensus Experience implementing a BFT-style consensus protocol  Who are we? At RDX Works, we're a team of like-minded thinkers who have long been convinced that we're living in the earliest stages of a global financial revolution. This revolution is being fuelled by decentralized finance (or DeFi for short), which is enabling an assortment of pioneering developers and entrepreneurs to re-invent almost every financial product that is currently traded and invested in traditional markets, without requiring central authorities or siloed infrastructure. DeFi has captured a great deal of attention and investment in the crypto-aware niche, growing assets under management from $1 billion to over $200 billion in a few years. Impressive as its growth has been, its current market size isn't even a rounding error on the over $400 trillion held in traditional finance. We're focused on what it will take to go from billions to trillions.RDX went back to first principles to come up with the right technical solution—the first layer-one protocol built specifically for mainstream DeFi—and we have already tested out at over 1 million transactions per second. We're keenly aware that the need for an infinitely scalable platform is only one prerequisite among many for mass adoption, and we're also blazing new ground in the areas of purpose-built developer tools, user experiences, and regulatory integration.We have forged a path deep into the future of what distributed ledger technology is going to look like and we need you to come and be part of the team that is making that happen right now.If this job sounds like it was made for you, then please apply directly via the link or email errico.dipiazza@rdx.works for more information. Alternatively, if you feel like you don’t match all of the requirements, we would love you to still apply anyway.

Sr. Software Engineer (Rust);https://startup.jobs/sr-software-engineer-rust-materialize-2474465;Berlin, Germany;no;"Materialize is the streaming SQL database company that makes it easy for any developer or analyst to understand streaming data, answer complex questions and build intelligent applications using standard technology. Whether it’s delivering personalized experiences, accurately identifying fraud, building predictive AI, or discovering new business opportunities, the ability to run complex queries on multiple streams of data and keep their answers up to date is critical to making better decisions about the changing world around us.
 
We are focused on bottom-up developer adoption, our core software is free to use and source available, our business model is a cloud product that handles management of Materialize and lets businesses focus on building value. We have a vibrant developer community on Slack and as much as possible we work in public on GitHub.
 
Who We Are:
The Materialize team includes engineers who were early employees of Cockroach Labs, Flink, Dropbox, and YouTube. Our work builds on top of Timely Dataflow and Differential Dataflow, both created by our co-founder Frank McSherry, a world-leading computer scientist with decades of award-winning research in all aspects of data.
 
Investors:
Kleiner Perkins, Redpoint Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Additional investors include executives from Cockroach Labs, Datadog, and Rubrik.

About the Role:

We are looking for seasoned Engineering generalists with extensive experience leading technical architecture and who are proficient in Rust, C++, Java, or functional programming languages. It's vital to also have experience working with large data sets, distributed systems, and backend development, as well as an interest in developing software in Rust.
 
Materialize is deployed on top of streaming message queues, like Kafka, and allows users to specify arbitrary SQL views on top of their queues and query those views instantly. Stream processing software like Kafka has greatly improved the end-to-end latency of moving messages around in real time, but today there's no good solution for making use of that data easily. Materialize brings the user-facing simplicity of SQL views - for arbitrary SQL queries, not just some SQL-inspired minimal language - to the streaming data ecosystem.
 
All of this is only possible because Materialize is built on top of Timely Dataflow and Differential Dataflow, both of which are award winning projects with strong theoretical foundations. Materialize's Chief Scientist and co-founder Frank McSherry built Timely Dataflow over years of research. Timely was inspired by an earlier Microsoft Research project (also led by Frank) called Naiad, which won several academic accolades including best paper at SOSP 2013.
 

What You Will Do:

Design, implement, ship, and maintain substantial parts of Materialize in Rust.
Evolve Timely Dataflow and Differential Dataflow to meet the needs of Materialize.
Iterate on Materialize to discover and adapt to customer needs.
Collaborate with other engineers and product management.

 
What We’re Looking For

Strong working knowledge of computer science fundamentals, equivalent to a B.S., M.S., or Ph.D in Computer Science. Timely and Differential Dataflow are built upon years of academic and industrial research, and you’ll need to become familiar with the research areas.
Comfort with writing substantial new code and modifying existing, mature code.
Experience building distributed systems.
Experience writing high-performance systems is a plus.
Track record of learning new technologies and concepts quickly.
Ability to work both autonomously and collaboratively, as needed.
Strong written and verbal communications skills. 

Bonus Points

Knowledge of streaming processing.
Experience with Rust.
Experience implementing data infrastructure.
Experience in compilers.

Our dynamic team has incredible perspectives to share, just as we know you do, and we take great pride in being an equal opportunity employer.";;;

Software Engineer - VoIP (Go/Rust);https://startup.jobs/software-engineer-voip-go-rust-element-3152653;Remote;yes;Who We AreElement is the startup that employs the core team behind matrix.org— the leading project for secure, open decentralised communication.Matrix’s mission is to make messaging as open as email — allowing everyone to choose where their data is hosted, enjoy private conversations thanks to advanced encryption, and ultimately be in control of their own communication.Matrix powers Element, our flagship messaging apps for the web, iOS & Android, along with Element Matrix Services (EMS), our SaaS platform for personal & professional use.We build things for everyone, and we know we can’t succeed without a diverse team. Our hiring process is designed to be humane and give candidates the best chance to show us what you can do. If we ever fall down on this, please let us know.The RoleElement is heavily investing in building out Matrix as the missing signalling layer for WebRTC: providing an open and decentralised E2EE transport for negotiating media streams and data channels. On top, we have recently extended Matrix to support scalable decentralised E2EE group voice and video calling too (MSC3401). These are the base building blocks for visionary applications such as Element Call as well as the open metaverse (aka third room). For the sake of scalability and reliability in conferencing, a selective forwarding unit (SFU) has proven to be one of the crucial components. The concept is already part of MSC3401. The VoIP team will be responsible for designing and implementing a Matrix compatible SFU which can be extended to support a generic media connector model. We also aim to connect to more legacy systems, e.g., SIP / PSTN, as we are trying to work on interoperability with a unified collaboration & communication vision. Currently Element Call relies on a full-mesh node setup. You’d come along to help evolve the SFU, using a modern stack that ensures future compatibility and an end-to-end responsibility for VoIP conferencing. Our VoIP team ensures that there is a communication layer for an open metaverse, so this is a great chance to make a big impact on the future of communication.Since (almost) everything we do is open source you can get a great feel for exactly what it would be like to work on the team, come and say hi!RequirementsAs part of our VoIP Team you are fascinated by real-time audio and video processing.

Currently valued at $1B and backed by leading investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase Ventures, Worldcoin is a new, collectively owned global currency that will be distributed fairly to as many people as possible. Worldcoin will launch by giving a free share to everyone on Earth. We believe that this is an essential step to accelerate the transition towards a more inclusive global economy, providing new ways for everyone to share future prosperity. We hope you’ll join us on our ambitious journey.
About the Orb
Worldcoin's launch requires a ""Proof-of-Personhood"": a way to determine someone is human (not a bot) and hasn't already claimed their free share of Worldcoin. This is why we developed the Orb.
The Orb is an advanced biometric imaging device, custom-designed for Worldcoin's launch. Orbs are deployed to a global network of operators, who use the device to onboard new Worldcoin users. During this onboarding, the Orb will generate a hash of each user's iris and submit it to Worldcoin's trustless backend (built on Ethereum). For more details on how the Orb is part of Worldcoin's privacy-preserving approach to Proof-of-Personhood, see How the Launch Works.
The Orb solves a fierce combination of engineering and UX challenges, centered around image quality, security, and ease-of-use. Each device has an advanced iris imaging system, designed to work consistently across real-world lighting conditions. An additional suite of sensors feeds into an onboard fraud detection system, enabling use in unsecured environments. These systems are combined in a sleek industrial design with a simple, minimalist user interface.
About the Team
The Orb Software team is a small group of industry experts, software generalists, and passionate hackers - collectively driven by Worldcoin’s ambitious mission. We're responsible for all software running on the Orb, plus software for manufacturing, automated testing, and fleet management. The multidisciplinary nature of the project requires us to work closely with Security, Backend, Hardware, and AI & Biometrics teams.
Our team embraces the challenges involved in bringing the Orb to life. In this pursuit, we value first principles thinking, pragmatism over perfection, and the sanctity of deep work. We empower each other to own large projects end-to-end, and strive for excellence as a team. 
About the Opportunity
We're actively seeking senior software engineers to join the Orb Software team. Our current priority is developing and enhancing the Orb’s core features. These include: imaging each user's iris, performing advanced anti-fraud checks, and securely communicating with Worldcoin's backend.
As part of the Orb Software team, you may find yourself working on projects like:

Prototyping a new autofocus algorithm.
Benchmark and tune the performance of our neural networks.
Implementing a device driver for a new sensor.
Stress-testing our OTA update mechanism.

Your code will affect how millions of people experience the Orb, and is thus a critical factor in Worldcoin’s success. 
About You
We strongly encourage you to apply for this position if you are motivated by Worldcoin's mission, have exceptional software software engineering abilities, and thrive in a fast-paced environment.
We're especially interested if you have:

5+ years experience in systems programming, robotics, IoT devices, or related fields.
Extensive experience using Rust in real-world applications.
Familiarity with GNU/Linux and device trees.
Experience building security-critical applications.
Excellent communication and project management skills.
A mission-driven and team-oriented mindset.

Senior/Staff Engineer, Backend - RUST;https://startup.jobs/senior-staff-engineer-backend-rust-forallsecure-1925160;Remote;yes;"Senior/Staff Backend Software Engineer (Rust, Remote)
Come help us build the best API testing tool, by developers, for developers.
Who are we?
ForAllSecure is a group of people united by a shared mission: making the world’s software safe & reliable. Our first step towards that goal is to democratize fuzzing.
Fuzzing is an automated testing technique with huge impact. Microsoft reports that 80%+ of their security vulnerabilities are discovered by fuzzing. But only the biggest tech companies and best vulnerability researchers have had the resources to leverage fuzzing. We are here to break down these barriers and bring fuzzing to the masses.
Continuous fuzzing will transform how we test software in our industry at large. It will be as fundamental as unit or integration testing, and we are responsible for making that positive change happen. It will empower developers to build better and safer software, faster.
What will you do?
You will join a small team passionate about API testing. We believe that there is a better way to develop and test web APIs, and that fuzzing is part of the solution. We are driven to deliver that and help out all the API developers out there.
We are looking for people with the same passion to help build this nascent product. Your day to day will likely involve, among other things:

Adding features to our CLI and web API that will unlock more value for our customers.
Working with our customers to understand how we can better provide a valuable & delightful experience.
Coming up with feature ideas, and owning them from start to finish (ideation, validation, implementation, delivery, docs, ...)
Optionally, improving our custom fuzzing engine, to improve our speed, coverage, and bugs it finds.

You don’t know fuzzing, or much about security? That’s alright! We’d love to teach you. And there’s plenty of work around the fuzzing tech (CLI/API) if that’s something you’re more comfortable.
Oh, and everything (but frontend) is written in Rust. So if you like Rust, you’ll have a blast. If you don’t know Rust but are curious about it, we’ll help you learn it as well!
Who are we looking for?
We do not care about your credentials, or whether you can implement a red-black tree in a coding interview. Instead we care about the following:


Passion. Our mission resonates with you, and you are excited to drive it forward.


Empathy. You care deeply about your co-workers and your customers. You will make technical decisions affecting our users, and we want users to always be on top of mind. 


Curiosity. You love to learn. You love to get better at things, through reading books or blog posts. You consider yourself a fast learner.


Writing skills. You appreciate and are inspired by well-written documentation. You like writing your thoughts down and sharing them with others.


Coding skills. We do not require formal education, but we do expect you to be a proficient coder. Again, you don’t need to know rust, but you should want to learn it (and will need to). Ideally, you’d have dabbled with web APIs before.


More specifically, on the technical side, we are looking for:

Experience developing backend stack (API, Database, background jobs). Specific frameworks and tools are less important.
RDBMS experience (ie: PostgreSQL)
Experience operating web services in production and handling incidents.

In addition, you will likely end up using Jenkins, Docker, Terraform, Google Cloud. We don’t require experience in those, but we do expect a willingness to learn! There are also technologies that you might end up using based on interest, including fuzzing and frontend dev.
Our Team Culture
Culture is very important to our team, and therefore wanted to share with you what you can expect if you were to join us:


Small & lean team. Highly motivated & lean team. You’ll be the 3rd engineer on the product.


Remote-first. We have folks on both US coasts, and in Canada.


Speed: Eric Ries claims speed at which you iterate is key. Iteration is not only about software, but about ""validated learnings"". He advocates a scientific approach to product development, built around quick validation of hypotheses using data from customers. This involves things like Reid Hoffman’s paper testing, and continuous delivery (we ❤️ Accelerate)


Data-driven decision making: Iteration speed enables data-driven decision making. Instead of arguing about what to build, we look at the date collected from customers. Many times, the decision requires more data and the discussion shifts to how we can get it.


Empowerment: Another important aspect of our decision making is that our team is empowered to make decisions. This avoids a number of issues. First, given that we are on the ground and close to customers (see ""Empathy"" below), we have the most context on how we can provide value to them, which is how we make this product successful. Second, we avoid design-by-committee issues. Third, giving team decision-making authority allows them to remain nimble & fast, there's not a lengthy approval process for inconsequential decisions.


Focus: The result of iteration speed & data-driven decision making is focus. We might not always build stuff that customers want (mistakes happen, and that's ok -- see below). But the important part is we only keep what customers want. We don't want any dead weight slowing us down.


Psychological safety: iteration speed reduces the impact of mistakes. We avoid investing too much effort without regular validation of the work. So, in our team, we embrace failure, and failure is just another ""validated learning"". This gives the team psychological safety, one of the 5 elements of high performing teams. On the technical side, continuous delivery also dampens any mistakes we make. While a mistake may find its way to production faster, it also gets fixed in production faster. 


Empathy: Engineers are close to customers. We get unfiltered feedback right from customers instead of playing a game of telephone. We can ask clarification questions. We can test our hypothesis. This also gives us the context and empathy we need in order to make good decisions. The product would not be successful if we did not do that. The empathy we gain from talking directly to customers also leads us to put a huge focus on usability, simplicity and user experience.


Async communications: Another aspect of our decision making is that we embrace written communications over meetings. It enables the writer to be more deliberate with their thinking. They have the time to do research and build a coherent and backed case. It gives people a shared background to start an informed discussion. More specifically, we follow an RFD process for important technical decisions.


Work-life balance. We care to have well-balanced & diverse team members. We can’t have that if we expect folks to work crazy hours. Heads up, you will however be expected to be part of an on-call rotation.";;;

Sr. Software Engineer, Linkerd Proxy (Rust);https://startup.jobs/sr-software-engineer-linkerd-proxy-rust-buoyant-3209036;Remote;yes;"Hi, we're Buoyant.We build Linkerd—the lightest, fastest, simplest service mesh for Kubernetes.Linkerd is an open source project. It has a thriving community of adopters and it powers the production systems of companies around the world. Companies like Microsoft, Nordstrom, Timescale, Expedia, and many, many more use Linkerd to add critical security, reliability, and observability features to their Kubernetes applications.We’re a small company with an incredibly outsized impact on the world. We’re remote-first and fully distributed with team members all over the world. Our competition is fierce: every day, we take on some of the largest companies in the world with essentially infinite dollars and infinite engineers to devote to their competing projects. Our secret weapon? Focus, and a deep sense of empathy for our users.Working here is not for the faint of heart.What's Linkerd?Imagine taking ultralight, ultrafast L7 ""micro-proxies"" written in Rust, sticking them next to other people's applications running on other people's clusters, and having them mediate all TCP (and in the future, UDP) communication to and from these apps—no matter what it is. Imagine these proxies upgrading connections from HTTP/1 to HTTP/2, initiating and terminating mutual TLS, retrying requests, emitting fine-grained metrics, issuing CSRs to the local CA every n hours, and so on. And imagine the end user blissfully operating 10,000 of these proxies, as a whole, with an easy-to-use CLI and API. That's a service mesh.(The best way to learn more is to try it yourself. If you can run Kubernetes, you can get Linkerd up and running in 5 minutes.)Under the hood Linkerd is extremely sophisticated and deeply technical, but the key to the entire project is simplicity. It's extremely difficult to make a simple service mesh, and very easy to make a complex one. (Heck, look at pretty much any of the other options.) And simplicity in this case means operational simplicity: it doesn't mean that you get a one-click install wizard, it means that whenever Linkerd is running, you can understand what it's doing and predict its behavior. It means no leaky abstractions, no complex tuning, no hidden gotchas. We spend a lot of time and energy in ensuring Linkerd is simple—it's our central promise to our users.Linkerd is a graduated-tier project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, just like Kubernetes, Prometheus, and other defining projects of the cloud native space. It's written in Rust and Go; Go powers (most of) Linkerd's control plane. Rust powers Linkerd2-proxy, the source of Linkerd's true power. We're the only service mesh that uses something like Linkerd2-proxy, and it's a tremendous differentiator.On the commercial side, we make Buoyant Cloud, a cloud-based management system for Linkerd. Buoyant Cloud makes Linkerd stress-free to operate. You connect your existing deployments, and Buoyant Cloud monitors their health and alerts you if anything looks weird. It takes on the toil of upgrades, data plane management, and more. In short: Buoyant Cloud turns Linkerd into a managed service, even though it's running on your own clusters.What are you looking for?In this role, we're looking for people who want to work on Linkerd2-proxy. Linkerd2-proxy is built in Rust on top of frameworks like Hyper, Tower, and Tokio. It's not trivial code: Linkerd2-proxy has to be extremely performant, extremely lightweight, and it has to gracefully handle any network traffic that the application sends to it, no matter what. It has to be capable of scaling up to huge levels of load and handling tens of thousands of concurrent connections, and scaling down to consume the smallest amount of resources in low-traffic situations. And it's not just throughput-sensitive but latency sensitive: every millisecond of additional latency in the proxy means can add 10s of milliseconds of latency to the user's application. And it has to handle all of that gracefully, without requiring complex tuning, without having unpredictable resource usage, and while running in a container on unpredictable hardware with an unpredictable network.This is a Rust job, but we are not looking for Rust-only idealogues. We're a small company and everyone wears a lot of hats. You will need to write some Go. You will need to interact with actual users and treat them nicely even if they ask silly questions.Linkerd is an open source project, and it feels like one: we have a lot of users, a continuous stream of GitHub issues and Slack messages asking for help or describing problems or asking when something is going to be ready. The cloud native space is rife with buzz, FOMO, and distraction. You need to be able to be productive in that environment.We interact with our Linkerd users in the community Slack and we try to engage with them authentically while not being distracted. You don't have to deliver keynotes at Kubecon (unless you want to!), but participating in the community is part of your job.We’re a team, not a family, but we have families and are the kind of place where work doesn’t get in the way of that. There will be crunch times, but work life balance is important and our p95 work times are pretty good for a startup.This is an extremely technical project that pushes the boundaries of modern network software. If that sounds fun, this just might be the job for you.This might be a good role for you if you have:
Eight or more years of professional software engineering experience developing high-performance, low latency network services.
Expert-level understanding of Linux operating system fundamentals and network programming.
Expert-level Rust programming skills, ideally with the Tokio ecosystem.
The ability to navigate complex software engineering tradeoffs between performance, maintainability, future-proofing, end-user experience, and feature completenessExcellent written communication skills.
The ability to work with in a distributed team with members across with different timezones.
Familiarity with Linkerd, Kubernetes, gRPC, and containers.
A weird but adorable love of software infrastructure.
In this role, you will:
Write mission-critical, high-performance open source code in Rust and Go. Yes, there will be some Go programming involved. No complaining allowed!
Design and implement complex features at the intersection of network programming, operating systems, Kubernetes, and cloud native deployment models, in collaboration with other team members.
Give and receive critical feedback on design and code while maintaining a supportive and friendly environment.
Ensure performance and correctness of Linkerd across multiple dimensions, including traffic load, protocol choice, resource constraints, and product requirements.
Develop high-scale reliable test tooling and environments, drawing from experience working on production systems.
Solve problems (aka fight with) CI/CD tools, Linux systems, networking, and the rest of the complex ecology in which Linkerd lives.
You should be:
Low-ego, collaborative, and results-oriented.
Able to give and receive constructive feedback.
Willing to learn from and mentor teammates.
Passionate, empathetic, and kind.
Buoyant is a fully distributed, remote-first company. Applicants from anywhere in the world are encouraged to apply. However, working hours must overlap at least partially with US or EU timezones.";;;

Are you passionate about systems engineering and understand what it takes to build and operate memory-safe, resource-considerate, high-performance backend APIs in a distributed environment in Rust? If so, we’d love to talk to you about joining us in building next-generation GraphQL infrastructure.With more and more GraphQL APIs being deployed by product teams in organizations, routing to distributed graphs with minimal latency is key to operating them at scale. In this role, you’ll have a critical impact in architecting and building infrastructure that graph operators with demanding workloads can deploy confidently into their production environments.We have tier-1 backing from Andreessen Horowitz and Matrix Partners and our technology is used in production by some of today's largest and most innovative companies, including Airbnb, Netflix, Expedia, Peloton, DoorDash, The New York Times, Zillow and many more. What you'll do
Write and deliver fault-tolerant infrastructure code in Rust and read code written in other languages, like TypeScript and Java.
Lead, mentor and guide other engineers in architecting and writing code in idiomatic Rust.
Consult in architectural discussions that consider how to best operate and observe graph routing software in customer’s infrastructure stacks. 
Communicate your ideas and designs clearly and up front, aligning with technical Product Managers on their designs and documenting them for end users.
Collaborate with other engineers across the organization and within our open source community using supportive communication and constructive code-reviews.  
Who you are
You understand operational expectations for running API infrastructure, including deployment strategies, optimization techniques, extensibility and observability needs and performance characteristics. It's a plus if you have a strong understanding of GraphQL.
You are knowledgeable in cloud and systems technologies, including both the architectural principles and the specific tools of the trade along with their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, Kubernetes knowledge is a plus.
Collaborating, mentoring and empowering others to do their best work is core to how you work.
You enjoy reviewing code, getting your code reviewed and seek feedback from your team early and often.
You're pragmatic and you know how to make tradeoffs between different designs in the pursuit of urgency. You optimize for overall business goals, not just immediate technical results.
You deliver. Shipping working software and seeing it in the hands of end users brings you great satisfaction.

Why Deliveroo?
When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges, and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London in 2004 and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. In 2013 Deliveroo was launched. Fast forward to 2020 and we operate in 12 markets with over 60,000 riders who deliver orders from 60,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide.
We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want when they want, where they want it.
We work with riders, restaurants, and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real-time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in around 30 minutes.
And we're just getting started.
The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.
We are already a multi-billion pound company that has grown rapidly. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest-growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.
Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away, and relocation.
We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgment when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion, or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.";;;
