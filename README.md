To be able to run web scraping code in this repository and actually scrape the data, you will need Scraping Fish API key which you can get here: [Scraping Fish Request Packs](https://scrapingfish.com/buy).
A starter pack of 1,000 API requests costs only $2 and will let you play with the API on your own ⛹️.
Without Scraping Fish API key you are likely to get instantly blocked ⛔️.

Scraping Fish is a premium API for scraping powered by rotating 4G/LTE proxy by default.
It is the best available proxy type for scraping since mobile IPs are ephemeral and constantly reassigned between real users.
This type of proxy is capable of scraping even the most demanding websites without being blocked.
You can read more on advanced topics in Scraping Fish API [Documentation](https://scrapingfish.com/docs/intro).
